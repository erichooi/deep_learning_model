three marianist brothers named in a pennsylvania grand jury report detailing widespread sexual abuse of more than children across the state were assigned decades ago to daytons former chaminade high school the president of chaminade julienne catholic high school said tuesday along with other catholic men and women in our nation and around the world we are horrified by the news coming out of the grand jury report in pennsylvania and other reports of misconduct of members of the clergy of the catholic church said daniel meixner president of chaminade julienne catholic high school which succeeded the former allmale chaminade high school records maintained by the marianist province of the united states show that three men named in the pennsylvania grand jury report each worked at chaminade high school for a year each meixner said two of the men worked at the school in the mids the third worked at the school in the early s meixner said the province which is headquartered in st louis reports no allegations of inappropriate conduct by the three men during their assignments to chaminade high school additionally meixner said cj administrators have received no reports of impropriety from students concerning vowed religious who worked at the school investigation ransomware costs riverside thousands hinders access to police systems we grieve for those who suffered any harm at the hands of priests and vowed religious who were entrusted to be their shepherds of faith meixner said in a statement in our distress and anger we join the call for accountability for them and for those bishops priests and religious leaders who protected or shielded them for many years chaminade julienne has joined the efforts of the archdiocese of cincinnati to create a safe environment for our students through rigorous employee background checks and continued child protection training required of all employees and volunteers meixner said after reviewing the grand jury report the dayton daily news and news center this week asked administrators at daytons two marianistsponsored schools chaminade julienne and the university of dayton whether any of the three marianists named in the report worked in dayton the newspaper offered the two schools a deadline of tuesday afternoon to respond i do not know when we will have something said shawn robinson a university of dayton spokesperson when asked if the university intended to respond to the news organizations request he said the school was looking into the request the explosive grand jury report detailing sexual assault of more than other child victims by more than vowed religious in pennsylvania has sparked widespread condemnation in the us and elsewhere in the catholic world squeezing pope francis the us bishops and the vatican with questions over who knew what when the allegations against the marianists each stemmed back to their time working at north catholic high school north of pittsburgh in five adult males reported they were abused by brother william hildebrand the grand jury report said the allegations included inappropriate touching and genital groping during the s and s hildebrand died in six complaints were filed against brother john keegan according to the grand jury report the allegations of abuse in the s and s surfaced in and accuse keegan of masturbating victims and asking them inappropriate questions four adult males and one female reported abuse by brother frank meder in the s and s the allegations include spanking and fondling after offering children candy and leftovers from the cafeteria meder died in one victim said meder often gave the children pop and candy he would then line the children up and have them take turns sitting on his lap in a rocking chair in his office the report said he recalled that as a child he always wondered what was in brother franks pants when he got older he realized that brother frank had an erection

vacations its a good time to make sure everyone in the company is sensitive to the need for computer security here are some basics that owners should emphasize to their staffers passwords start with creating a strong password its probably a good idea for the company to have minimum requirements for passwords used to access its systems those requirements should include a mix of upper and lowercase letters numbers and symbols many businesses are using twofactor authentication which requires people to enter a code in addition to the loginpassword combination they may also require staffers to periodically change their passwords the irs has guidelines for creating passwords on its website wwwirsgov search for tax tip while the information is intended for tax professionals it is useful for anyone phishing alerts bosses should remind everyone to be vigilant about phishing scams which can plant malicious software on a computer or phone everyone should understand that they shouldnt click on any link or attachment in an email unless theyre sure its legitimate it should be standard operating procedure to check a senders email address to be sure its correct and not suspicious and the body of an email should be checked for any oddities that can be hallmarks of phishing scams as new staffers are trained they should learn about the kinds of emails they can expect to receive the more familiar they are with a companys customers vendors and other contacts the better theyll be at spotting suspicious emails locking phones and laptops staffers who can access the companys systems including its email via smartphones and laptops whether theyre personal or companyprovided should be required to lock their devices with codes or passwords downloading updates if the company has an information technology staffer or department it should be aware of security and other updates issued by microsoft and other companies each company device should be updated if there isnt a dedicated it staffer the owner or another manager needs to be sure that all updates are downloaded the owners responsibility a survey issued earlier this year by insurer hiscox found that only half of small businesses said they had a clear cybersecurity strategy making systems as secure as possible often gets put on the back burner while an owner works with customers and staffers companies without it staffers should consider bringing in a consultant who can assess whats needed to increase security among the items companies need are antivirus and antimalware software firewalls encryption software

more multipurpose malware attackers increasingly are distributing malware that can be used for a variety of different tasks kaspersky lab says in a troubling trend for enterprises an analysis of botnet activity in the first six months of shows that multifunctional malware tools are becoming increasingly popular among attackers kaspersky lab inspected more than malware families and their modifications across some botnets around the world and found that the share of multipurpose remote access tools has almost doubled on botnets since the beginning of from to the three most widespread of these rats or backdoorsnjrat darkcomet and nanocoreare all malware tools that attackers can relatively easily modify for different purposes or adapt for distribution in specific regions kaspersky lab discovered njrat to have command and control centers in countries mainly because of how easily attackers can use it to configure a personal backdoor with very little knowledge of malware development nanocore and darkcomet have c centers in over countries for the same reason similarly trojans capable of being modified and controlled by different command and control servers and used for different purposes were another category of malware that grew in q though not quite as dramatically as rats kaspersky labs analysis showed that the share of such trojans increased from in the second half of to around in the first six months of over the same period the proportion of singlepurpose tools being distributed through botnets declined substantially for example the share of specialpurpose banking trojans distributed via botnets dropped over from around in the second half of to of all malicious files in the first half of similarly the share of spamming bots which are another category of singlepurpose malware dropped to this year from almost in h of ddos botsanother category of singlepurpose toolfollowed a similar pattern dropping from around in q and q last year to about in the first six months of this year botnets on a budget one factor driving the trend is the relatively high costs of operating a botnet says alexander eremin security expert at kaspersky lab bots can be costly so botmasters are looking for every opportunity to make money from their malware tools multipurpose malware allows bot owners to quickly adapt their network for different purposes from delivering spam for instance to distributing banking trojans and ransomware he says the trend is driven by significant botnet ownership costs criminals will attempt to take everything at the first chance eremin notes the emergence of multifunctional malware means that users need powerful protection as criminals try to steal users credentials money sensitive data using the same malware sample botnets increasingly are being used according to the needs of the operator at that time so it is often difficult to identify the primary specialization of a botnet he says the kaspersky lab report is the second in recent weeks to warn about an increase in multipurpose and adaptive malware tools earlier this month security vendor proofpoint said it had seen a recent increase in the use of modular downloaders that allow attackers to modify malware after it has been installed on a system basically the tools allow adversaries to fingerprint infected systems and then modify or update the malware based on items of interest that the downloader might identify on a system modular malware like the multiplepurpose tools that kaspersky lab highlighted in its report this week is problematic for enterprises because of

the love from india on the ransom note is to be believed the filelocking malware targets microsoft windows users and is delivered to victims via an executable named a big presentexe which if run will encrypt files with a thbec extension victims are shown a ransom note and given instructions to visit a dark web address in order to pay an unspecified ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency image check

intimidated into not reporting the attack to the police with the attackers claiming law enforcement cant help you see also what is ransomware everything you need to know about one of the biggest menaces on the web researchers at check point analysed ransomwarrior and found it to be the work of seemingly inexperienced attackers and were able to retrieve the decryption keys from the malware check point succeeded due to the weak encryption used by the ransomware which is a stream cipher that uses a key randomly generated from hardcoded keys in the ransomwarrior binary code as the keys index is saved locally on the victims computer to provide the means of unlocking the files researchers have been able to build a decryption tool for anyone infected by ransomwarrior while many cyber criminals have switched focus to cryptocurrency mining malware as a stealthier and less risky means of acquiring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ransomware still remains a prominent cyber threat instead of deploying mass spam campaigns in an effort to infect as many users as possible the most successful ransomware campaigns have developed new tactics in many cases the attackers put time and effort into compromising whole networks before eventually pulling the trigger on the ransomware infection its this form of targeted campaign that helped one cyber criminal operation make over m and which continue to net an additional each month read more on cyber crimedetected instances of cryptojacking the unauthorized commandeering of computer resources to mine cryptocurrencies went up nearly in the first six months of this is one of the insights presented in the trend micro midyear roundup report titled unseen threats imminent losses noticeable shift released on august the report states that methods employed by hackers to extract value from device owners have shifted from ubiquitous highly visible malware attacks to the relatively silent but no less devastating deployment of cryptojacking a quote from trend micro summary of the report reads throughout the next few months we also saw a noticeable shift away from highly visible ransomware to a more discreet detection cryptocurrency mining these damaging threats from the miners that quietly leech power from victims devices to the serious vulnerabilities that leave machines open to covert attacks split limited security resources and divide the focus of it administrators in june ccn reported that kaspersky labs expressed a similar opinion stating that cybercriminals are slowly moving away from ransomware toward cryptojacking according to the trend micro report detection of unauthorised cryptocurrency mining more than doubled from the second half of which was not completely unexpected given that the annual report predicted a marked uptick in future cryptojacking incidents even more interestingly according to the report trend micros researchers also detected a growing number of cryptojacking malware families which would seem to indicate that the already keen interest of cybercriminals in cryptojacking is growing h cryptojacking statistics according to the report the first months of this year saw trend micros security systems record a increase in cryptojacking detection in the same period new cryptocurrency miner malware families were detected and the tactics of cybercriminals kept changing and evolving constantly in january malvertising was detected in googles doubleclick program and in february advertisements were injected by the droidclub botnet into websites in march cybercriminals favoured the adware downloader icloader and in april web miner script was found on aols ad platform earlier ccn reported that one in three uk businesses were hit by cryptojacking in july monero remains the cryptocurrency of choice for cryptojackers illustrated by another report which showed that over ispgrade routers were have been affected by a monero cryptomining attack unwanted crypto mining on a computer or a network can have a host of negative effects including slowing down performance wearing down hardware and increasing power consumption greatly in the context of an enterprise environment which is reliant on several networked devices this problem is exponentially magnified security researchers have urged network administrators to protect themselves from cryptojacking by constantly monitoring power usage and looking out for suspicious or unauthorised activity featured image from shutterstock the post crypto mining attacks up nearly in first half of appeared first on ccn cryptocurrency scams replacing ransomware as attackers fave cryptojacking miners and fileless malware see biggest growth in first half of the incidence of cryptocurrency mining malware continues to skyrocket as the bad guys refocus their efforts away from ransomware in favor of the easy money that cryptocurrency offers them the latest evidence of the trend came by way of a new report released earlier this week that examined attack data for the first half of cryptojacking numbers dominated the reports highlights as researchers from trend micro showed that the volume of cryptomining attacks for the first half of the year was almost double the number of similar attacks during all of comparing likeforlike the cryptocurrency mining detections increased more than ninefold in the first half of compared with the first half of meantime the number of ransomware families declined in this years first half compared with the second half of last year in addition ransomware growth slowed considerably only inching forward by about from the first half of the year compared with the last half of the recent change in the threat landscape mirrors what weve seen for years cybercriminals will constantly shift their tools tactics and procedures to improve their infection rates said jon clay director of global threat communications for trend micro in a statement meantime the report showed that unusual malware types such as fileless smallfile and macro malware are all seeing significant upticks this corresponds to a different report out this week from sentinelone that shows fileless attacks rose in the first half of and in fact the trends of fileless malware and cryptocurrency mining malware have been seen to cross over as of late late last month researchers with kaspersky reported the growing prevalence of powerghost a fileless malware family that preys on corporate networks to siphon their machines compute power as they explained powerghost creators combine the cryptojacking capability of any other malicious miner with the super stealthy characteristics of a fileless malware like any miner powerghost uses your computing resources to generate cryptocurrency this reduces server and other device performance as well as significantly accelerates wear and tear which leads to replacement costs however compared with most such programs powerghost is more difficult to detect because it doesnt download malicious files to the device some experts believe we will see more cryptomining botnets trending in this direction as corporate systems and networks tend to offer attacker a veritable open buffet of compute power once they can find a way to ingratiate their malware onto machines the latest powerghost malware shows there is renewed interest in creating botnets from enterprise workstations and servers explained sean newman director of product management at corero network security earlier this month he said this is in contrast to a lot of recent botnet attack activity around iot devices with the significantly higherpowered cpus in these devices compared to iot its not surprising that they are now the target for computeintensive cryptomining activities he added related content black hat europe returns to london dec with handson technical trainings cuttingedge briefings arsenal opensource tool demonstrations

there was a percent increase in cryptojacking attacks over the first half of cryptojacking refers to unauthorized cryptocurrency mining which can end up consuming a victims system resources for now it does appear that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future but with cryptocurrency values changing quite wildly we could see a decrease in this threat jon clay director or global threat communications for trend micro told eweek we do think well see an increase in targeting of owners of cryptocurrencies or the exchanges themselves as the opportunity to steal more coins is higher there than the prospect of mining coins multiple organizations have warned about the rise in cryptojacking in a report from security firm palo alto networks released on june estimates that attackers have generated at least million in illicit earnings from cryptojacking while cryptojacking attacks have grown in the first half of ransomware attacks have stalled somewhat trend micro reported that ransomware detections in the first half of were up by only percent from the second half of its currently unclear if ransomware will grow faster in the second half of it is hard to say whether well see this threat reemerge but with cryptocurrency values wildly fluctuating the threat actors may decide ransomware is a more stable money maker clay said but what could offset this are the improved technologies to detect ransomware at time zero which means the actors may have to improve their malware creations or create better obfuscation techniques with this threat ransomware attackers are being more selective with their attacks targeting businesscritical systems because businesses will be more likely be pay them to restore these systems quickly doing so also allows them to increase their ransom demands he said in addition to cryptojacking attackers are profiting from business email compromise bec attacks trend micro observed that bec attempts grew by percent in the first half of compared with the second half of according to an estimate released by the fbis internet crime center on july between december and may there was a percent increase in identified global exposed losses from bec attacks vulnerabilities the trend micro report also includes data on vulnerability disclosures taken from the companys zero day initiative zdi division which is in the business of acquiring vulnerabilities from security researchers the zdi report which was released in july found an increase in industrial control system ics and supervisory control and data acquisition scada system vulnerabilities the increase in the number of scadarelated vulnerabilities is a good thing as were seeing researchers focusing more in this area and allowing us to responsibly disclose these

study that this year cryptojacking attempts are making the most significant impact ever in its midyear security roundup the company said it recorded a percent increase in cryptocurrency mining detections in the first half compared to all of and a increase in detections versus h this indicates cybercriminals are shifting away from the quick payout of ransomware in favor of the slower behindthescenes approach of stealing computing power to mine digital currency the report said the study also showed cybercriminals are veering away from attentiongrabbing ransomware attacks to more clandestine methods but with the same intention of stealing money and precious computing resources this article appeared first on cryptovest cryptojacking attempts up ten times in first half of recommendedmany manufacturers are lowhanging fruit for hackers today how did we get to this point cybercriminals historically focused on stealing credit card numbers and sensitive personal information like social security numbers as a result healthcare finance and retail organizations were the top priorities for hackers additionally these targeted industries are subject to stringent information security regulations while manufacturing is not for these reasons its been easy for some manufacturing leaders to deprioritize security the threat environment is changing however hackers now seek to monetize cybercrime through ransomware and electronic payment fraud meaning theyre looking for companies with easy vulnerabilities to exploit unfortunately many manufacturers fit this bill sikichs manufacturing report found that less than of respondents said they are very ready to address cybersecurity risk and believe they are only somewhat ready and threats are growing with the rise of the internet of things and robotics advanced technology continues to expand throughout manufacturing operations which can increase cybersecurity vulnerabilities so the time for complacency is over manufacturers must work aggressively to improve information security preparedness they must eventually put in place comprehensive security programs that include regular risk assessments penetration testing and vulnerability scanning but they can get started with six key initial steps to shore up vulnerabilities and ensure theyre no longer easy targets for hackers strengthen passwords for many people strengthening passwords means including symbols and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters however password complexity is less important than password length sikich frequently performs penetration tests for manufacturers during these tests we seek to hack into a companys it system to identify vulnerabilities in our experience if a company uses eightcharacter passwords we usually break in no matter how complex the password requirements are but if a company uses characters even with minimal complexity eg letters with no symbols or numbers we almost never break in so manufacturers should implement companywide password policies that force employees to choose longer ideally character passwords instead of shorter complex ones improve controls over remote access remote access to an it system is an essential element of modern business by providing employees access to key systems and documents from any location remote access facilitates productivity and collaboration however it also provides more entry points into a network to ensure remote access doesnt turn into a cybersecurity liability companies must use dualstep authentication with dualstep authentication for remote access a hacker who steals or guesses an individuals network password cant use the password to breach the network perimeter additionally companies should strictly control remote access for vendors and carefully vet vendors security practices manufacturers must ensure vendors adequately test for security vulnerabilities and follow strong security practices such as using unique passwords when they access different customers systems pay attention to default settings when a manufacturer installs new it systems it should thoroughly review the default settings on the machines in some cases these default settings can open back doors into a companys it system for cybercriminals with windows operating systems for example default settings are in place to ensure that newer machines can interact seamlessly with older versions of windows while these settings may facilitate more operational efficiency they introduce vulnerabilities into the it system the company would be much better off replacing old versions of windows entirely and turning off these easily exploitable legacy settings in addition to reviewing default settings when it adds or updates software a company should also perform quarterly vulnerability scans to identify other potential weaknesses in system configurations manage patches many manufacturers use offtheshelf thirdparty applications for online shopping or blog sections of their websites theres no inherent problem with this however management of these applications requires vigilance these thirdparty applications release patches but they dont update automatically a manufacturer must log into the websites for its thirdparty applications on a regular basis to download and activate any patches while these updates require some extra effort from a manufacturers technology team they are crucial to ensuring a consistent high level of security filter traffic manufacturers should closely monitor traffic on their networks and have protocols in place to block malicious traffic these efforts can stop many breaches in their tracks almost every breach includes some sort of malware commandandcontrol channel in other words when malware infects a machine it communicates back to the hacker for instructions on what to infect and exploit a strong internet filter will recognize the difference between normal traffic and this commandandcontrol traffic and effectively trap viruses limiting their damage further with strong filters in place an it team can quickly identify and clean the affected machine improve employee vigilance as hackers increasingly target users of it systems employees across a manufacturing operation are on the front lines of cybersecurity threats so one of the most important things companies can do is educate employees on how to recognize and handle suspicious emails thirdparty security experts can carry out a practice phishing campaign in which employees receive fake phishing emails to test their vigilance and awareness testers can then share the results with management and highlight areas that need improvement prepare for the worst despite a companys best preventative efforts breaches can still happen therefore manufacturers need to develop a comprehensive postbreach incident response plan if a breach happens time is of the essence so a manufacturer should plan how it will put its security team into action and what outside resources it will tap additionally the company needs a thorough communications plan that details how it will explain the incident to customers and respond to any media inquiries it should also have access to a lawyer who can advise on all necessary reporting regulations from a technical standpoint a company should ensure its servers and workstations log all important events and store at least six months of data in the event of a breach logs help forensics investigators determine how and when a virus infiltrated a system and what data was stolen commit to a comprehensive cybersecurity overhaul overlooking even a couple of these keys to success can be damaging for manufacturers for example a company may have advanced antivirus software and regularly update patches however if it doesnt have strong filtering and an employee clicks on a phishing link a virus can infiltrate its network and wreak havoc thats why manufacturers need to execute a comprehensive cybersecurity overhaul with concerted action today manufacturers can shore up vulnerabilities and protect their operations from disruption kevin bong is a senior

work environment from nefarious influences enterprise backup solutions provider comport shares ways to prevent ransomware attacks any company small or large runs the risk of having their data systems compromised by ransomware having key technology locked down and held hostage will always negatively impact productivity and in certain cases can cause a catastrophic loss of data comport is invested in keeping all aspects of a companys technology protected and provides some key tips to prevent ransomware infiltration before it becomes a problem back up your data on a daily basis while a comprehensive security plan to keep data protected is integral in protecting against damage from ransomware one of the best ways to address the risk is to make sure that no key data would be lost in event of an attack backing up data on a daily basis may seem excessive but having redundancies in file management can go a long way toward ensuring that important assets stay protected if a data management system happens to be locked down by ransomware having access to a recent copy can make the situation far less devastating use quality passwords one of the easiest ways to prevent ransomware attacks is with proper password management but many companies fall short with their stringency regarding the practice regular password changes that utilize a lengthy combination of alphanumeric characters in both upper and lowercase as well as special symbols can make it far more difficult for an outside actor to compromise a system changing passwords frequently and enforcing best practices may be a hassle but an it department can make their jobs much easier if they prioritize these simple security measures educate employees those responsible for information technology within a company may do their best in taking appropriate steps to protect the company but user error can render these efforts ineffective educating nontechnical employees regarding safe browsing habits the password management guidelines mentioned above and even using mock drills to prepare workers for potential infiltration attempts can thwart attacks before they can take hold an educated workforce makes it much easier to protect a company from data loss and the associated expenses and hassle encrypt information while some sophisticated ransomware can reencrypt encrypted files making data difficult to access can prevent a lot of potential threats if they happen to get through the precautions taken above encrypting the entirety of a companys data may not be feasible but for information that is integral to business such as trade secrets or customer information this extra step is more than worth the effort encrypting data wont work in all cases but for many attacks it will stop infiltrators in their

powershell attacks are the ones to worry about this year security analysts report endpoint security firm sentinelone today published its h enterprise risk index report which shows filelessbased attacks rose by between january and june powershell attacks spiked from attacks per endpoints in may to attacks per endpoints in june ransomware remains popular ranging from to attacks per endpoints the rise of fileless and powershell attacks wasnt a major surprise to aviram shmueli sentinelones director of product management and leader of this report who says the two are especially appealing to threat actors who want to fly under their targets radar fileless attacks are more sophisticated they dont leave any trace he explains adding that these types of threats are increasingly common in user data the powershell spike tells us powershell attacks are here to stay shmueli says fileless lateral movement and document attacks made up of all attacks analyzed in the report fileless and powershell attacks are powerful and attackers can leverage either to do significant damage he says its worth noting the two can overlap powershell lets actors access internal components and can be fileless in nature enabling them to evade detection this report isnt the only one pointing to the popularity of powershell among cyberattackers earlier this year mcafee published findings indicating a spike in fileless malware samples spreading powershell in the fourth quarter of alone compared with the same time period one year prior when it comes to which threat is easier to execute shmueli says powershell might be the more accessible option powershell is already installed on windows systems so attackers can rely on the fact that its already there without installing anything else he adds this is why we believe attackers choose to use this vector so frequently however the simultaneous increase in fileless attacks indicates threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and turning toward advanced forms of cybercrime its becoming less difficult for them to create payloads that wont get caught complicating defense for targets researchers investigated the drivers behind the recent spikes in fileless and powershell attacks but couldnt point to a specific reason driving the increase this seems to be more of an overall growing trend than a spike related to a particular campaign while all three threat vectors are popular shmueli says companies should be most cautious about fileless campaigns the spike was preceded by an incremental rise in fileless malware that is likely to continue i believe that we will see a growing number of fileless attacks and powershell attacks he adds as for ransomware hes not so sure the trend is not so constant he admits sentinelone will continue to

download across all android tablets and phones epic games the fortnite app on android can be hijacked by hackers to instigate worm attacks on players google has revealed epic games ceo tim sweeney acknowledged the issue which allows other apps on a users device to silently install unapproved software in the background but said google should have waited longer to reveal the problem the disagreement is the latest in a longrunning dispute between the two companies and comes after epic refused to make the android version of its hit game available on the official google play store yes telling users that a flaw was found and advising updating is valuable but again why did google have to rapidly disclose the technical details who does that help other than hackers tim sweeney timsweeneyepic august mr sweeney explained his decision to only make the fortnite app available through the epic games website by saying the per cent cut of sales that google took could not be justified the great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required he said at the time the popularity of fortnite has made it a magnet for cyber criminals with some targeting players before the android version of the game was even released fake versions of the app were shared across social media earlier this summer some of which contained ransomware that encrypted all of the data on the infected device until the victim paid a ransom in bitcoin according to cyber experts the latest vulnerability could be the first drop in a flood of security problems for fortnite on android as fortnite continues to grow in popularity it will become a greater vector for launching malware and ransomware with malicious actors possibly even pivoting to kinetic ransomwarestyle attacks lawrence pingree a cyber security specialist at sonicwall told the independent with kinetic ransomware victims are forced to complete an action to regain access to their encrypted devices we saw this in april with the pubg ransomware which forced victims to play a game called playerunknowns battleground for one hour to decrypt the device while this instance was benign the potential implications are far reaching and quite dark such instances of the malware mr pingree warned could eventually spread beyond individuals to companies or governments forcing officials to carry out sinister acts to regain control of their systemsberlinblackberry knows what its fans want after the launch of the blackberry keyone last year and the blackberry key in june the new key le joins its two precedessors in sticking to the basics of what really appeals to blackberry usersthe keyboard announced here at the ifa tech trade show the blackberry key le varies slightly in design and hardware but boasts the device elements for which blackberry is known privacy and security interestingly blackberry didnt feel the need to try something dramatically different with the le the rumored nokeyboard blackberry device and the even more unlikely palm device were nowhere in sight several months after launch the key can be found in most of blackberrys core markets and should be available in all of them by late september theres also been increased device deployment and enterprise interest in the businesstobusiness bb space design and features the key le is intended to build off the success of the key and broaden blackberrys appeal by acting as an entry point for new customers and markets that means in both design and price the le is the more affordable less premium version of the key the lighter weight and plastic build does make it seem a little less durable but the key le still has a pane of gorilla glass on the front the back is grippy and felt quite comfortable in my hand dimensions are mostly the same as the key meaning it can be a little wide if youre trying to use it with one hand the inch p screen is sharp and fairly bright though it may be reflective in direct sunlight the screen certainly reflected the light in the brightly lit room in which i gave the smartphone a spin most other physical features are the same you get the same buttons in the same location including the programmable function key on the side which by default is mapped to google assistant with a single press or google lens with a double press unlike samsung with bixby functions arent hardcoded so you can remap it to the app of your choice the keyboard is approximately percent larger than the keyones and has the same easytopress angled keys as the key i found the typing experience to be comfortable each key is individually programmable through new speed key functionality which enables shortcut access from anywhere on the device at any time where the key has an almost industrial look with sides of machined aluminum and a weighty feel the key le is more lightweight and has a bit more flair it comes in several colors with a band of bright red blackberry calls it atomic champagne and more standard silver running along the sides and in the seams between the keys the back is still padded with a soft touch finish and stylish but the new color options are a nice departure from the conservative professional design on the keyespecially for users who arent going to use it for business the one omission here is the removal of the capacitive gestures that allowed you to swipe on the keyboard for different functions blackberry says it removed them because most customers who might be interested in the le are more keen on using the keyboard itself rather than another side feature camera software and specs the key le may not compromise too much when it comes to most physical features but it is scaled back in specs its powered by a qualcomm snapdragon processor and comes with gb of ram rather than the chip and gb of ram you get on the key the two storage options are gb and gb models youll find a mah battery under the hood charged by usbc with some added intelligent software features that can provide contextual reminders to charge it for instance the phone will keep track of your calendar so it can remind you to charge when you have events coming up the key le will also refrain from reminders when the device knows youll be using it theres also qualcomm quick charge fast charging with the included adapter blackberry says customers can get hours of battery life out of the key le under standard usage but well put it to our more intensive streaming test back in the pc labs to see how it does we generally werent too impressed by the camera on the key and it doesnt look like the le will change much in that regard however it is worth noting that blackberry added portrait and slomo modes in the le theres a mp and mp rear sensor which took okay shots in terms of clarity and color reproduction when tested in the brightly lit room during our hands on launching the camera app felt a bit slow and took a couple seconds to snap photos the key le also doesnt seem like itll do too well in lower light settings but well reserve judgment for more thorough testing software should be more or less identical to the key that means you get a device running android oreo with an update to android pie promised in addition blackberry has some of its own custom apps and software including the dtek security dashboard app and locker which helps you manage device security and status locker is particularly interesting because you can lock various apps hiding them from access until an additional fingerprint unlock or pin code is entered if you have selfies on the risque side you can put photos in locker and keep them from being synced to the cloud blackberrys midrange smartphone play blackberry may call the key le entrylevel but its closer to what wed consider midrange in the unlocked market the gb key le should start at while the gb version should come in at that puts it in the same range with the midrange moto g and just shy of higherend unlocked phones like the oneplus most notably the key le comes in at a more palatable price point for us consumers who tend to buy phones from carriers and only buy cheaper unlocked devices the real sales for the key le may not come from average consumers but from businesses the le is geared toward fitting the budgets of finance and law firms that may want to equip their entire management level with a range blackberry devices for example senior management might get the more costly key while junior managers get the le regardless were looking forward to putting the blackberry key le to more comprehensive testing and will update as we discover more details on lte bands and carrier availability stay tuned for morecryptojacking attacks have been increasingly prevalent in even finding their way into the ubuntu linux software center mark shuttleworth the founder of canonical and ubuntu linux isnt too worried though as he has multiple technologies in place to mitigate risk in a video interview with eweek shuttleworth provides insight into the technologies that ubuntu uses to help secure applications and users from multiple risks including cryptojacking in a recent cryptojacking attack in ubuntu applications were found to be conducting unauthorized cryptocurrency mining on user desktops the issue was quickly resolved serving as a proof point for the resilience of ubuntus snap application packaging system for helping to keep systems updated in the architecture of snaps themselves we put a lot of work into being able to shape the container and define what the container is allowed to do shuttleworth said any application that comes into the snap store has to be very explicit about all the things it wants to do the snap store provides ubuntu users with an application repository that has been packaged in the snap format ubuntu has been building out the snap format since at least as a way to package and secure applications in the recent ubuntu update snaps became a core element of operating system as well shuttleworth said the snap platform enables ubuntu to revert software wherever it is another core attribute of snaps is that there is cryptographic provenance for software and as such shuttleworth said canonical knew exactly where the cryptojacking software came from because the app was a snap we were able to act immediately and solve the problem very quickly he said shuttleworth said canonical now also has an upload scanning process so that every app that is submitted to ubuntu is analyzed for potential malware before the software is made available to end users kernel live patching for other types of security issues like the recent meltdown and spectre cpu security vulnerabilities ubuntu users can benefit from kernel live patching capabilities that were further enhanced in the ubuntu update with live patching a running system can be patched without the need to reboot which is important for production deployments as well as the cloud there was one round of the meltdown and spectre vulnerabilities that was so deep and invasive that we couldnt live patch it but most small security issues in the linux kernel can be addressed with kernel live patching shuttleworth said overall shuttleworth emphasized that canonical will continue to balance the needs of an open ecosystem in linux with the requirements of providing secure and stable software infrastructure for end users and enterprises security has become a top priority for me and for canonical its one of the top drivers of engagement for us he said watch the full video with mark shuttleworth above sean michael kerner is a senior editor at eweek and internetnewscom follow him on twitter techjournalisthow one companys cybersecurity problem becomes anothers fraud problem the solution when security teams see something in cyberspace they need to say something fraud isnt something new or something that only happens on the internet identity theft has been around for decades what has changed is how fraud is executed not only are individuals targeted but now entire companies can become targets for fraud for example what are phishing sites masquerading as legit websites if not attempts at counterfeiting the identity of that company cloud service providers and bluechip software companies are especially desirable targets for fraud bad actors infiltrate corporate networks not to hack the corporations themselves but to coopt their infrastructure hackers use stolen credentials to hide behind ip addresses servers and domain addresses to wage covert cyberattacks misleading investigators and compromising corporate infrastructure in the process in my research ive uncovered the three most common scenarios of what my team calls cyberenabled fraud which we define as fraud that is facilitated though the use of malware exploits social engineering andor lateral movement through a compromised website network or account note that all there of these can be and many times are used in conjunction with one another phishing bad actors send a phishing email to steal your credentials usually by having you click on a masked hyperlink directing you to a welldone spoof of a legitimate website there you are asked to list information like usernames passwords social security numbers birthdates or financial information these phishing emails can also be designed to install ransomware when you follow their directives social engineering when you spoof the email of the companys ceo directed to the cfo or someone else in finance to see if he or she will wire money to an account controlled by the bad guys social engineering can also accomplish some of the goals of phishing such as gaining sensitive information or getting credentials over the phone or on occasion in person you arent being asked to do something like click on a link but you are asked directly to provide sensitive information lateral movementresource sabotage once bad actors have gained access through phishing or a vulnerability exploit there is further fraud that can be committed they can use that access to compromise other machines or servers in a company often with the help of any fraudulent credentials theyve managed to obtain and they can use these compromised systems to send out malware and malicious spam or use bandwidth and resources for crypto mining all of these actions result in infrastructure becoming compromised in some way but the larger end result is that my cyber problem has just become everybody elses fraud problem because my infected system is now set up to attack other systems heres an example of cyberenabled fraud in action there are two cloud service providers cloud a and cloud b bad guys use prepaid or stolen credit cards to purchase a virtual server account with cloud a and through that server send out malware that is using the server for fraudulent purposes when they are finally caught which can take months and the account is shut down the bad guys immediately open up an account using the same credentials with cloud b if cloud a and cloud b are willing to work together and exchange threat intelligence information with cloud a flagging that account as fraudulent they can stop the cyberenabled fraud much faster this drastically changes the economics for the fraudster cyberenabled fraud is part of a vicious virtual cycle the good news is we can break this cycle by using best practices in cybersecurity that protects our own identities and assets as well as the larger cyber ecosystem its taking the concept of when you see something say something into cyberspace communicating about the cyber incidents you experience to others will help them better detect potential acts of cyberenabled fraud when you take care to protect yourself you are helping your virtual community fight off cyberattacks this research was provided by the trustar data science

biotrying to manage a sprawling complex data center via manual data input and monitoring can increase the likelihood of data input errors and can cause it administrators to miss incidents but artificial intelligence technology can help admins track all their data center components and automate data collection from an operational standpoint automating operations using ai can lower overall costs and simplify installing software and hardware still organizations must make sure that they implement the right capabilities and have realistic expectations of ai capabilities instead of trying to immediately install functions that attempt to replicate the human brain organizations should focus on using machine learning and big data for ai machine learning enables admins to start building automation on a much smaller scale with individual functions instead of requiring an expensive hardware and software upgrade machine learning is the most common approach to developing an ai framework because machine learning software collects data that is important for future use integrates it into the function and improves how the machine responds to tasks automation just completes the task and moves on to the next task without any data analysis with machine learning software routines data pools and algorithms admins can train the data center to perform certain tasks automatically such as filtering spam requests or flagging ransomware attacks different types of algorithms include logic programming decision tree learning reinforcement learning and bayesian networks that develop ai capabilities over time investing in machine learning a machine learning program needs enough intelligence to accurately and consistently identify and take action on current events in the data center such as distributed denialofservice and bruteforce breach attacks being able to automate and analyze event data is an effective way to integrate ailike capabilities into the data center as ai capabilities continue to advance the software will become more humanlike the machine learning software should be able to identify where physical resources will run out and procure and provision new resources in time as well as shift workloads as required a machine learning tool should also report against past incidents and learn from patterns to better optimize itself to deal with every day and future events as time passes to minimize the need for manual admin intervention admins utilize these types of capabilities in security information and event management software but this is only one component of the data center and admins might want to track data across the entire setup or automate other software productsvancouver bcat the open source summit north america here on aug greg kroahhartman warned attendees about the severe impact the meltdown and spectre cpu vulnerabilities could have on them as well as detailed how linux kernel developers are dealing with the flaws kroahhartman is one of the worlds leading linux kernel developers with responsibility for maintaining the stable linux kernel and is employed by the linux foundation as a fellow during his talk kroahhartman detailed the root impact and the response of linux kernel developers for seven variants of meltdown and spectre though he saved his strongest criticism for intels initial disclosure jann horn discovered the first issues in july of but it wasnt until oct of last year that some of us in the kernel community heard rumors of the flaw he said thats a long time and we only heard rumors because another very large operating system vendor told intel to get off their tails and tell us about it the meltdown and spectre vulnerabilities were first publicly acknowledged by intel on jan the original research was reported to intel by multiple researchers including horn from googles project zero effort kroahhartman said that when intel finally decided to tell linux developers the disclosure was siloed normally when we get a kernel security bug it goes to the linux kernel security team we drag in the right people we work with the distributions getting everyone on the same page and push out patches he said intel siloed suse they siloed red hat they siloed canonical they never told oracle and they wouldnt let us talk to each other for an initial set of vulnerabilities kroahhartman said the different linux vendors that typically work together however in this case they ended up working on their own and each came up with different solutions it really wasnt working and a number of us kernel developers yelled at intel and pleaded and we finally got them to allow us to talk to each other the last week of december he said all of our christmas vacations were ruined this was not good intel really messed up on this kroahhartman said the linux kernel is developed and run by a wide variety of organizations and there are both corporate kernels that are backed by large vendors as well as community kernels kroahhartman said the majority of the world does not run on a corporatebacked linux kernel he noted that intel is used to working with companies and only initially worked with corporate vendors on meltdown and spectre the majority of the world runs debian or they run their own kernel kroahhartman said debian was not allowed to be part of the disclosure so the majority of the world was caught with their pants down and thats not good intel responds to intels credit kroahhartman said that after linux kernel developers complained loudly to the company in december and into january it fixed its disclosure process for future meltdown and spectrerelated vulnerabilities with the most recent variant of meltdown and spectre which has been dubbed foreshadow and was publicly disclosed on aug kroahhartman said linux kernel developers were properly notified ahead of time so that fixes could be made in a collaborative way by the linux community intel has gotten better at this he said an interesting side effect of the meltdown and spectre vulnerabilities is that linux and windows developers are now working together since both operating systems face similar risks from the cpu vulnerabilities windows and linux kernel developers now have this wonderful back channel were talking to each other and were fixing bugs for each other kroahhartman said we are working well together we have always wanted that fixing the flaws all the reported meltdown and spectre vulnerabilities have been fixed in modern supported linux kernels according to kroahhartman he warned however that not all fixes have been backported to the older linux kernel and advised users not to run any untrusted code on systems running that kernel while there have been many patches made in linux he strongly advised users to update with intels microcode fixes as well as they provide an additional layer of protection beyond what an operating system can provide kroahhartman also warned that the meltdown and spectre issues will be around for a long time as new variants are likely to emerge the fixes for the initial meltdown and spectre variants have required a lot of effort from kernel developers and kroahhartman said that there are efforts underway to develop more automated fixes we are not going to be playing whackamole for the next years he said kroahhartman added that there needs to be a reliable way to automatically find the bugs or to have an updated compiler that detects vulnerable code patterns and removes the flaws research is ongoing on different ways to accurately detect meltdown and spectre type issues in code he said security has always been important kroahhartman said this was just yet another bug and any bug can be a security bug sean michael

montgomery county said greg flannagan the spokesman for prosecutor mat heck more marianists named in pennsylvania abuse report worked at daytons chaminade the statute of limitations of any complaint

overnight at the rectory and slept in the same bed as premoshis one morning the victim awoke with cream on him which he later realized was semen the report said premoshis also took the victim on numerous overnight trips and vacations including to waynesboro virginia atlantic city new jersey dayton ohio and to myrtle beach south carolina the report said during one trip the victim awoke to find premoshis fondling the victims genitals at which point premoshis jumped back into his own bed when the victim asked premoshis about what he was doing the previous night premoshis said he did not

stanley kubriks dark vision advertisement ai in the real world is providing vital clinical support for doctors allowing retailers to offer curated shopping experiences and driving efficiencies and performance across a broad range of industries unfortunately the cybercrime industry is no exception a study from mcafee estimated the global cost of cyber crime at billion the firms most recent analysis places that figure at an astounding billion about percent of global gdp the most significant change within that time span is the explosion of ai and machine learning thanks to the wide availability of gpus that make processing power faster and cheaper the proliferation of inexpensive sensor technology and wireless connectivity and the birth of the cloud providing virtually unlimited storage capacity for the vast amount of data being collected every day the terms ai and machine learning are often used interchangeably but theyre not the same ai refers to all machines that can perform tasks characteristic to human intelligence basic ai applications rely on code with rules and decisiontrees if x then perform y consider a spam filter it can be programmed to delete or divert all emails from specific addresses just as a human would otherwise do manually machine learning is a facet of ai machine learning trains an algorithm so that it can learn by feeding huge amounts of

trend micro report indicates that phishing attacks are expected to net billion in that figure will only keep rising because it works a study from security firm phishme found that percent of cyber attacks start with a user clicking on a phishing email a growing number of companies are training their people to recognize phishing attempts but advanced ai is making defense trickier said kevin richards global head of cyber risk consulting marsh as ai can learn endusers responses to different tactics and adjust accordingly a target being heavily spammed might mark the emails as junk or try other tactics to stop the influx but the learning engine is changing the attack look and feel just enough that it bypasses the security controls he said at some point the user will click unsubscribe to make it go away thats when the malware actually gets delivered said richards and its kind of insidious because youre trying to do the right things spearphishing or phishing for specific credentials or data is highly lucrative so attackers are willing to put in the time to gather what they need compiling publicly available information and social media data in search of clues on how to approach each target with believable but fraudulent emails assisted by machine learning algorithms however bad actors can get to their end game in a fraction of the time artificial intelligence can help process massive amounts of data and put together connections and build profiles of people that can be used for social engineering said zeilman with ai you can compile data on a massive scale and very quickly and create things that are way more comprehensive deep learning can also process communication and behavior patterns to make social engineering attacks seem so authentic that virtually no one would suspect foul play recent reports on deepfake video techniques add a new level of alarm its possible to envision a scenario where criminals could fake a skype call with a cfo instructing subordinates to wire money to a specific account even employees sufficiently trained on security procedures might consider bypassing those procedures when presented with facetoface orders from the boss increased ease of gathering credentials is also contributing to a booming crimeasaservice industry on the dark web cyber criminals are building databases full of dossiers of highvalue individual targets and their credentials a phisher can now be someone who doesnt even have to know how to code he or she can just buy credentials on the dark web almost as easily as ordering from amazon machine learning is boosting the cybercrime economy in other ways including services that allow developers to upload attack code and malware to analyze how security tools from different vendors are able to detect it white hats vs black hats so the good news is that the good guys are actively using advanced ai technologies to detect and defend against cyber incursions the bad news is that the bad guys are working just as hard i think that the good guys had a head start so thats worth something said zeilman but im not sure how long thats going to last a lot of times the real question is the motivation what motivates the bad guys to use this new technology and the answer to that is usually money he said advertisement cyber criminals tend to be lazy so if they can get away without using ai and still make tons of money theres not a lot of incentive for them to move into that field but if the defenders start using ai and it becomes difficult for the bad guys to keep up then theres a lot of motivation for them to get ahead of the defenders keep up with their business model and continue to make lots of money zeilman said innovation unfortunately can happen faster on the bad actors side because they dont really have things like quarterly earnings reports or outage windows for maintenance of the data center added richards they dont worry about those things theyre worrying about improving the yield of their attacks if these tools can help them be more efficient and more effective theyre going to continue their investment in making those tools more robust in addition what counts as winning looks very different from either side experts noted as the defender youve got to find all the holes and plug them up as the attacker youve just got to find one hole and use it said marlin thats always the issue here when youre playing on the defensive side the attackers only need a small hit ratio in order to succeed the deeper concern is where the lines will eventually be drawn and if theyll be drawn at all said zeilman the good guys are working on ai in established labs and they do so in tightly controlled situations with an eye towards the moral and ethical consequences of ai he said i think once you start getting people in the criminal sphere delving deeply into ai theyre not necessarily going to have those kinds of moral and ethical considerations in mind so were perhaps letting the genie out of the bottle cyber security is only part of the solution in terms of cyber coverage a cyber attack powered by advanced ai isnt going to change the way a policy responds but as the scale of cybercrime balloons risk managers should consider whether their insurance coverage is aligned with their risk exposure said joshua motta ceo of coalition a new firm that provides comprehensive cyber insurance coverage cyber security and risk management services criminals can now operate at unprecedented scale and efficiency and are using technology to their advantage to cause economic harm said motta its time he said for a shift in thinking while its true that many cyber attacks cannot be prevented the losses from cyber attacks can be i chose to focus on risk transfer because despite a companys best efforts there is always the latent risk of a cyber attack companies that are making best efforts at cyber security but do nothing when it comes to transfer have an incomplete solution in reality you need to be doing all these things you need to be able to prevent incidents from happening you need a plan for how to mitigate them when they do happen and you need a mechanism in place to help you recover and to help pay for any unforeseen costs you may incur following an incident only when you accomplish those things as a company are you prepared for the worst that could happen the hartfords marlin echoed mottas point given the constantly changing threat environment he said insureds need to be including resilience in the way they think about their cyber programs and cyber response the hartfords cyberchoice first response includes post incident remediation expense coverage which is an additional limit to be able to improve their systems even in ways unrelated to the claim itself we are committed to being partners with our insureds and we do want them to be better than they were even before the claim said marlin small to midsized businesses are the least likely to be prepared for an attack said motta largely because they dont understand why criminals would bother to attack them there are targets of choice and targets of opportunity he said targets of choice large companies like jp morgan or equifax are targeted in many cases for who they are targets of opportunity however often fall into the crosshairs because of a misstep in how theyve managed or configured their it infrastructure cyber criminals are scanning for nails that stick out above the surface such as obvious vulnerabilities in a companys it infrastructure once they find one they use their hammer in the form of an exploit to target or take a swing at the company and their vulnerable systems smaller businesses in particular said motta can benefit from partners who see the nails sticking out and show them what they can do about it understand the size of your footprint as the cybercrime industry continues to blossom risk managers need to be looking at the broader picture of risk and considering whether they have peripheral exposures as companies go more digital in their business processes the problem extends beyond corporate it said richards so this is becoming less about protecting my private data center and more about how my digital footprint has expanded across suppliers across the cloud across mobile across social media and they need to bring all of this into account the extended ecosystem said richards includes every digital relationship where something important to the company is being shared with third parties maybe ive outsourced part of a business process like manufacturing or distribution they have critical intellectual property now my cyber security program has to include them in my strategies risk managers need to ensure that their net covers all of that far too often that net falls short said richards it can be a little bit staggering that in some cases the ciso might only have visibility on maybe percent of their extended ecosystem meaning theres percent floating out there potentially wildly exposed and they dont even know about it let alone actively trying to protect it advertisement insurers are also actively considering their own footprints experts said and looking at the potential for aggregation exposure there are some worrying implications for risk accumulation or the likelihood that a single attack could trigger losses across a larger number of companies said motta frankly thats the biggest challenge for the insurance industry no matter what the class of insurance but its a particular challenge with cyber accumulation risk is more difficult to price because youre really talking about pricing catastrophic risk as opposed to pricing the everyday probability that an individual company is going to get hacked the postai cyber landscape could force a profound shift in the way underwriters approach cyber risks said zeilman every now and then a technological change essentially renders your past history certainly less relevant perhaps completely irrelevant he said all this data that we have at hand tells us to some extent how these risks are going to behave it might have to be thrown out the window because the future brings a significant technological shift that will cause cyber criminals to act very differently and will cause harm or loss experience to change in unpredictable ways

embedded artificial intelligence for enhanced email scanning automated email link analysis and other cybersecurity capabilitiesresearchers recently uncovered a method for completely bypassing all of the protections built into microsofts free enhanced mitigation experience toolkit but despite the crack in emets armor experts still believe the toolkit can be a valuable shield for enterprises using windows emet certainly raises the bar for exploitation this research doesnt make emet useless or pointless rahul kashyapchief security architect bromium the emet security tool applies a number of windowsbased protections most notably address space layout randomization and data execution prevention to thirdparty applications the tool is often touted by microsoft as a way to temporarily mitigate zeroday exploits however at the bsides san francisco conference last week researchers from cupertino califbased security vendor bromium claimed they were able to bypass emets defenses raising questions about the effectiveness of the tool rahul kashyap chief security architect and head of research at bromium said the companys emet research focused on among other weaknesses useafterfree memory corruption issues which can potentially be leveraged by an attacker to launch exploits in a research paper bromium researchers detailed how they were able to craft an exploit based on an old internet explorer useafterfree vulnerability that bypassed all of the emet security protections researchers had previously discovered partial bypasses to sidestep individual emet protections but never a complete bypass in the vein of bromiums discovery kashyap noted that the bypass shows fundamental weaknesses in tools like emet which operates on the basis of discovering known exploits such weaknesses he said will only become more prevalent as attackers utilize more unknown techniques going forward still kashyap admitted that the complexity of the exploit utilized by bromium was hardly trivial meaning that its unclear how quickly more emet bypasses may be discovered bromium worked with microsoft to fix this particular issue in the upcoming emet update which the software giant released in beta form at rsa conference version also promises to deliver attack surface reduction and plugin protection which could according to kashyap prevent the execution of malicious java payloads emet can continue to deliver value for enterprise security teams kashyap said as long they understand the toolkits place in an overall defenseindepth strategy in particular he said that companies with mature security programs should look to technologies that isolate threats in addition to emet and other endpoint tools that focus on detecting and blocking attacks emet certainly raises the bar for exploitation and dont forget this is a free tool coming from microsoft this research doesnt make emet useless or pointless kashyap said if you are trying to protect something which is important you need to have a much more wellthoughtout defensive strategy and you cant just use a tool like emet for that wei chen an exploit developer for rapids popular metasploit framework agreed with kashyap that emet should make it harder for attackers to write successful windowsbased exploits but that will only prove true if enterprises widely deploy the tool despite being free and available for nearly five years chen said that many organizations have yet to deploy emet for a variety reasons some have simply never heard of the toolkit he opined while others may be scared off by the potential application compatibility issues for example microsofts own skype application will not work while emet is active unless export address table access filtering is disabled chen said that many attackers arent writing exploits with thought given to bypassing emet though a recently discovered zero day targeting ie versions and reportedly would not deploy if the emet dll was detected on a machine despite writing exploits as part of his job chen said hes never been asked to take emet detection into consideration chen also noted that emet should only be viewed as a technology that blocks common software exploitation techniques not as a security cureall if a windows end user downloads untrusted files clicks on shady links or reuses passwords attackers simply wont care whether emet is on a system according to chen because theyll simply find easier ways to compromise a network if used properly though emet can be a vital security tool that helps block zero days and other exploits i think microsoft has been doing a pretty good job at raising the cost of exploitation by making it harder but not perfect as bromium pointed out chen said as a user youd be a fool not to use emetnecurs botnet goes phishing for banks a new necurs botnet campaign targets thousands of banks with a malicious file dropping the flawedammyy remoteaccess trojan the necurs botnet has resurfaced in a new phishing campaign targeting banks with malicious microsoft publisher and pdf files packed with the flawedammyy remoteaccess trojan cofense researchers first detected the campaign early on august and have confirmed banking domains have been hit so far recipients range from small regional banks to some of the worlds largest financial institutions necurs a rootkit first discovered in became famous in when it was spotted delivering large volumes of dridex and locky ransomware now its resurfacing with new tactics as threat actors experiment with different strategies to see which are most effective as far as this particular campaign it is a change from what necurs has been doing says jason meurer senior research engineer at cofense he compared the attack with a marketing campaign noting that it felt like there was a little bit of ab testing going on here this campaign differed from necurs usual strategy in several ways for starters it wasnt your traditional spam this was a phishing campaign specifically geared toward the banking industry using malicious attachments to deliver a payload designed to enable remote access it also leveraged microsoft publisher files a shift from typical word and excel documents a small subset of this campaign used pdf files which shows the attackers are trying different tactics its extremely rare to see publisher files in phishing attacks says cofense cofounder and cto aaron higbee while this type of file has been used in the past after all most employees are required to install publisher as part of office its not commonly seen in cybercrime digging into the details emails in this campaign are fairly basic researchers report with subject lines including request boi and payment advice with a random alphanumeric code tacked on the end higbee points out the phishing email was forged to appear as though it came from an employee at an indian bank a different indian bank cosmos recently lost million in a cyberattack when hackers broke into its atm server and stole customer information this campaign could potentially indicate a future atm attack says higbee and network access may be part of the actors motivation the malicious pub documents attached to phishing emails have embedded macros that when executed prompt a download from a remote host explain cofenses jason meurer and darrel rendell in a blog post on the campaign the final payload is flawedammyy which is malware based on leaked source code for ammyy admin it gives an attacker with full remote control of a compromised host which can lead to file and credential theft and enable lateral movement within target organizations flawedammyy had gone undocumented until early when proofpoint research indicated the trojan had been used in attacks as far back as january and as recently as march at that time attackers began to use a new distribution method of combining zip files with the server message block protocol to deliver flawedammyy onto target systems the march campaign dropping flawedammyy appeared to be the work of ta the same threat group associated with the dridex locky and globeimposter campaigns while cofense has not yet determined the motivation behind the latest necurs campaign higbee says people who have been studying necurs have linked the botnet to organized crime whats next for necurs now that the campaign has come to a halt meurer anticipates the attackers are probably taking a look at their commandandcontrol infrastructure to gauge the effectiveness of their strategy did pub files work for example or were pdf files more effective if there was little to no engagement theyll go back to the drawing board and look for another file format they can use to deliver the next wave he says if we see necurs do another phishing campaign using pub files its an indication people behind it were satisfied with the results its a call for banking institutions to stay on their toes banks should make sure their perimeter security is in good shape and their email gateways are updated the second thing is to make sure banking employees are aware theyre targets of cybercriminals just by the nature of the fact they work at

stab at an integrated appliance this time with hardware partner ixsystems the asigra truenas backup appliance combines asigras cloud backup evolved software with ixsystems truenas storage hardware because the new asigra backup appliances are at their core truenas storage devices they can be used for workloads beyond just backup this joint solution is broader than backup because of the functionality and the enterprise capabilities that truenas brings to the table said eran farajun asigra executive vice president the first asigra backup appliances launched three years ago farajun said asigra moved into hardware to simplify the buying experience for customers and lower their costs he found ixsystems truenas devices did a better job of that we looked at our own roadmap of what we wanted to build into our own appliances and the ixsystems solution really had that plus then some he said so we decided to form a partnership and to create new nextgen asigra appliances that are based on the truenas series the asigra truenas backup appliance is available immediately and sold exclusively through asigra partners the platform includes the x x m and m models with capacities ranging from tb to over pb the asigra truenas mseries appliance marks a partnership with ixsystemsfairmont fairmont public utilities commission on tuesday heard an update on the systems cybersecurity efforts troy nemmers public works director told the puc that education through bevcomm the citys internet provider is ongoing they bevcomm have a pretty advanced system in place nemmers said about the levels of security within the system last fall nemmers attended an executive cybersecurity class sponsored by southern minnesota municipal power agency and the us environmental protection agency he called the class eyeopening with the potential for attacks staggering the issue of infiltrating utility networks came to the forefront in july when the wall street journal reported russian hackers reached hundreds of victims in us utility control rooms the us department of homeland security said the penetration had the potential to cause blackouts financial institutions such as banks are the top target for hackers but power companies and utilities run second although fairmont is a small utility the threat is still there the highest risk stems from employees opening questionable emails and the possibility of those emails containing a virus that would permeate and cripple the power grid or ransomware that requires the utility to pay a ransom to regain control of its systems smmpa has offered to pay for training for all employees who have official municipal email accounts and the city coordinates with bevcomm to provide the training employees watch videos containing a specific lesson in cyber diligence and are given a link to learn more about the actual incident dramatized in the video there is definitely an applicable message nemmers said he noted that the training is tracked and regular updates are received to identify those employees who are not current on the videos in other business marty meixell electric distribution superintendent told the puc that a

scams hitting the real estate sector the real estate industry has been a fertile sector for online fraudsters for a decade or more and recent research says the scams have increased exponentially in a public service announcement released on july the fbi internet crime complaint center ic reported that the real estate industry has become especially susceptible to business email compromises becs and email account compromises eacs the attacks impact all levels of the industry including title companies law firms real estate agents and home buyers and sellers in the past year the highest victim losses reported in one month came in september at million meanwhile new research from proofpoint underscores the threats to the real estate industry the fraudsters prey on peoples good nature and desire to get business done says sherrod degrippo director emerging threats at proofpoint which published a blog last week that outlines the major security threats facing the real estate industry degrippo adds that real estate transactions typically include electronic signatures countless exchanges of documents via email and a variety of interactions with potentially unfamiliar contacts and of course theres also a lot of money involved when a real estate person holds a down payment that can be thousands possibly millions of dollars degrippo points out jessica edgerton executive vice president of operations and corporate counsel at leading real estate companies of the world says the real estate industry has been fighting these battles for many years part of the problem is that the modern realestate deal is a complex transaction involving a large number of number of parties all of whom are sending sensitive information via electronic means edgerton says more players and more electronic communications mean more potential holes for the fraudsters to sneak in and the stakes are high a home is the biggest purchase of most people lives down payments are significant chunks of money so real estatetargeted wire fraud is a lucrative business theres no doubt about it she says proofpoints degrippo says the five top threats the real estate industry and potential home buyers face are banking trojans malware that gets in between the user and an online banking session once they have the users credentials they can potentially steal the total amount of the transaction file downloaders threat actors will send an email with an attachment or link and as soon as the user clicks on it the criminal gains access to the users machine from there they can either steal valuable files from a machine or infect the computer with additional malware or ransomware one of the most common methods via an attachment that requires the user to enable macros or content within microsoft word which allows the downloader malware to pull other kinds of malware onto the machine information stealers the criminal gains access to the victims machine via installed stealer malware once that gets installed on a victims machine the attacker can steal passwords stored in a browser or sensitive documents stored on the machine including documents such as ws or other tax files corporate credential phishing here the hackers leverage a corporate brand to lure the user into clicking on a phish in the real estate industry bad threat actors often use the docusign logo fraudulently to get unwitting users to click on what seems to be a legitimate transaction consumer credential phishing attackers will use common home buying and consumer brands that frequently send notificationstyle emails including amazon and facebook to lure homebuyers into making fraudulent transactions gad naveh advanced threat prevention evangelist at checkpoint software technologies says real estate companies should start by keeping their business employees aware of the fraud problem in the real estate industry companies also need to have protection at their endpoints naveh says there are ways today to recognize if people are reusing their passwords companies can use tools to set policies for their business users not to reuse the passwords brokerages should consider educating sales agents and office managers about cybersecurity best practices edgerton says and that agents should educate home buyers about the potential for transactionbased fraud and home buyers should always pick up the phone and call the real estate office before wiring money to verify that the instructions are correct legitimate businesses are not going to send home buyers a link to verify their credentials she says as for the ongoing docusign scam in which home buyers are being lured to click on websites with fake docusign logos she says unless users are absolutely sure of the sender dont click on anything

step in recovering from ransomware is probably along the lines of dont get attacked by ransomware but as time goes by that seems to become less of a possibility the ransomware threat isnt going away and is actually evolving frankly the best strategy for recovery might be to prepare for the worst according to the verizon data breach investigations report ransomware is the most prevalent form of malware attack up from its spot at no in and no just last year this rapid ascent up the ranks shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone keeping up with data protection news but that doesnt make it any less alarming ransomware can be a costly disaster to recover from even if you dont pay the ransom in fact the first rule of ransomware recovery should actually be dont pay the ransom theres no honor among data thieves and payment does not guarantee the release of your data so what is there to do plan ahead for starters as ransomware evolves a simple backup plan wont cut it anymore and you have to keep recovery in mind early on whether your data storage of choice is cloud tape disk or flash you need to have a recovery plan catered to ransomware in particular unlike natural disasters ransomware attacks can strike any organization in any region and the results can be disastrous your priorities when recovering from ransomware will likely differ based on your organizations needs in many cases its not just a matter of getting your data back but complying with data protection regulations or agreements whether your priority is business continuity bc compliance or simply getting your data back as quickly and cheaply as possible this guide should help you gauge the threat ransomware poses for you and understand how prepared you are dont forget to stick around until the end where you can test what youve learned with our ransomware recovery quizaug am gmt tags thanks well email you when relevant content is added and updated following follow disaster recovery in the state of it resilience analysis firm idc estimates that as many as of organizations could not survive a disaster event the report claims longtime threats of hardware failure and human error have been minimized by advanced technologies only to be replaced by sinister threats such as ransomware many organizations do not have properly protected and staged offsite data have not tested the disaster recovery environment or do not have automated dr processes as part of documentation and planning said the report written by analysts phil goodwin and andrew smith the reasons for this are complex but principal among them are typically cost time and training the report commissioned by dr and resilience provider zerto defines it resilience as an organizations ability to protect data in the event of any unplanned or planned disruption and simultaneously support dataoriented initiatives for business modernization and digital transformation fortynine percent of organizations have suffered a data loss event in the last three years said goodwin an idc research director of storage systems and software in the past hardware failure and human error were among the biggest threats now ransomware and other types of malware are top drivers of data loss the cardinal sin of data protection is not being able to recover data goodwin said goodwin said an air gap creating a physical disconnect between primary and backup data is critical in protection from ransomware he noted that ransomware hitting backups is prevalent now replication for example doesnt have an air gap the cloud and tape though are two possible platforms for creating that disconnect damages rise quickly when youre down for the report idc received responses from seniorlevel it and business managers ninetythree percent reported experiencing a techrelated business disruption in the past two years in addition of respondents experienced major reputational damage and permanent loss of customers as a result of disruptions idc has determined that the average cost of downtime is per hour including indirect costs of lost revenue and lost productivity the survey results indicate that most respondents have not optimized their it resilience strategy evidenced by the high levels of it and businessrelated disruptions the report said however the majority of organizations surveyed will undertake a transformation cloud or modernization project within the next two years on the plus side organizations are taking advantage of the cloud for data protection goodwin said disaster recovery as a service draas has helped make dr more affordable and easier especially for businesses that might have previously balked at the cost and complexity draas has fundamentally changed the economics of disaster recovery goodwin said in addition of organizations plan to hire andor train more staff and expect to spend more on it resilience in the next months however if cost is still an issue goodwin recommended an organization figure out how to more effectively use people and technology resources take a look at process and improve that first goodwin saidfor some people with the neurological condition synesthesia can be a lovely thing when the sounds they hear also produce colors but computer scientists from tel aviv university the university of pennsylvania and the university of michigan have discovered a computer version of synesthesia that allows them to determine whats being displayed on a monitor by listening to sounds emitted by the monitor as you might suspect those sounds are very faint and not easily detected by human hearing but they are there as tiny highpitched tones produced by a monitors power supply in response to the varying demands of the screen display but special equipment isnt required to exploit the vulnerability thats produced by this characteristic of most monitors in their paper which was released on aug the scientists showed that those sounds could be recorded using the microphone in a standard consumer webcam by a smartphone or by a digital assistant such as an amazon echo or google home device furthermore this exploit does not require the presence on site of the attacker they can record the sounds over a remote call such as one from google hangouts the amount of information that the researchers were able to discern using their method was remarkable for example theyre able to tell what web page is being displayed on the monitor during a web call which means that they can tell if youre paying attention to the screen thats being shared or that youre looking up baseball statistics because eavesdroppers could tell what webpage youre viewing and determine the text that is displayed they could learn if you are filling out a form online and discover the personal information you are entering while its not clear if eavesdroppers can recover passwords this way if the contents of the password are obscured by dots or asterisks the researchers did learn that they can read the contents of the typing on touch screen keyboards touch screen keyboards have long been a favorite security tactic because they dont make the typical sounds made as users strike each physical key which can reveal whats being typed but the researchers found that they could discern contents typed on a touch screen keyboard because of the way it displays each letter as its typed with near percent accuracy if thats not enough to keep you up at night the researchers showed that recordings made in the past can still reveal those sounds which means that a recorded web call can reveal what was on your screen at the time of the call but so can the contents of your amazon or google cloud files recorded by your digital assistants whats happening according to the research is that some components in the power supplies of lcd monitors which is nearly all flatscreen displays emit faint sounds as the load on them changes the electrical load changes in response to changes in the pixels displayed on the screen so as the pixels change in response to computer inputs the load on the power supply also changes and that results in a change to the sound being emitted the researchers were not able to determine which specific component was responsible for the sounds and in fact it may be more than one of them however they discovered that this vulnerability affects most monitors with bit color depth which is almost all of them the text on the screen needs to be large enough to affect the power demands of the display so apparently really tiny text probably cant be read one of the reasons this worked is because the hz refresh rate on most monitors provides redundancy so if the sound cant initially be heard properly theres another chance every second the redundancy produced by the refresh rate on a monitor also makes it difficult to overcome the issue i asked the researchers if you could solve the problem by producing sound of your own such as by playing music there is leakage emitted through high inaudible frequencies which playing music nearby is expected to have little effect on explained roei schuster one of the authors of the paper in an email such a measure alone would not provide any meaningful guarantee and empirically the attack works well when recordings are made in a noisy office schuster said it might be possible to mask the noise produced by the monitor but he explained in the paper that it could cause other problems since some of the frequencies are within the range of human hearing however it may be possible to block such sounds he said the leakage can be attenuated using any soundabsorbing material we expect that embedding such a countermeasure in commodity screens and around screenembedded microphones would be expensive however when asked whether monitors with greater color depth such as highend k monitors are also subject to the same vulnerability schuster said it is yet to be verified that leakage exists in higher color depth screens but bit depth is used for almost all screens even when the researchers experimented with wildly varying screen attributes different manufacturer identities resolution production years and decades etc we observed similar leakage across the board said schuster so if you have a k monitor youre safe for now but theres no reason to think that such monitors dont emit their own sounds just that the researchers havent managed to decode them yet but remember this works on recordings so if they find out later this exploit works with k monitors than any recordings made in range of such monitors could reveal displayed information when asked if the exploit works with microsoft windows schuster said the researchers worked with the ubuntu distribution of linux which has a cleaner screen appearance but he suggested that there is no reason to believe that windows is any less vulnerable in windows different displayed letterswebsites will still have different and distinguishing acoustic emissions and this is what our neural networks leverage schuster said so what can you do if you routinely work with highly sensitive information other than not allowing any microphones into the same room with your computer theres not a lot you can add a lowpass filter to the microphone you use for web calls which will prevent it from hearing those sounds you can make sure that smartphones and digital assistants are in another room and you can make sure that theres no sensitive information on your screen when youre using hangouts or another voip application this situation is similar to a problem i worked with in the mids when i had to build a secure computer system for the us department of defense i had to prove that the emissions from the monitors i planned to use couldnt be overheard by the soviet surveillance ships parked offshore that was a different kind of noise but the result would have been the same today this is an obvious exploit for a statesponsored attacker they will have what they need from this paper to exploit this vulnerability for cybersurveillance now the next step is up to users with sensitive information now that they know it can be done they can find a way to overcome it and if you need another reason to stay awake at night two of the authors of this report published a paper in showing that its possible to steal cryptographic keys using acoustic noiselarger losses elevated risk and eroding capacity are the harbingers of a hard market its been a buyers market for healthcare liability insurance for the past decade or so hospitals and health systems have consistently enjoyed broad terms and conditions and declining or steady rates but a convergence of factors is ushering in a firming market and risk managers should know what to expect its time to prepare for an adjustment in the marketplace said tyler coleman senior vice president and head of healthcare north america at swiss re corporate solutions times are changing relative to what buyers have been accustomed to which is yearoveryear rate decreases and broad terms and when things do change they change abruptly increasing exposures rising loss severity and reduction of capacity are some of the trends that are hitting the market hard market driver losses are growing both more severe and more frequent conventional wisdom dictates that losses tend to be either highfrequency and lowseverity or viceversa but medical malpractice claims are bucking that trend a greater proportion of these claims are incurring severe losses and that severity continues to climb medical cost inflation contributes to rising claims costs but those increases have been compounded by recordbreaking jury verdicts more and more juries tend to take the side of plaintiffs who have suffered injury over large corporations who they perceive to have significant resources theres been a change in the jury pools expectation of what the outcome of a given procedure should be coleman said when plaintiffs dont get that outcome jurors see it as an injustice regardless of the facts of the case some plaintiffs attorneys have also accelerated this trend by devoting themselves exclusively to highseverity claims weve seen emerge a class of prosecuting attorneys with the experience and economic resources to drive larger verdicts coleman said big awards in highrisk venues are driving up average loss values nationwide hard market driver hospitals are getting bigger and so are their risk profiles healthcare systems risk profiles look very different today than they did prior to the passing of the affordable care act hospital consolidation and the employment of onceindependent physicians driven by aca incentives to eliminate costs and duplication of care create greater professional liability exposure for health care organizations historically physicians by and large were not a part of hospitals insurance programs they were separately insured coleman said but by employing these physicians hospitals take on that exposure today about percent of physicians practice independently that figure used to be percent so the exposure growth is significant increased exposure also comes from a larger patient population spanning wider geographies and a shortage of doctors available to treat them as people live longer and the population ages healthcare utilization goes up meanwhile fewer people are choosing to become doctors stretched to capacity existing physicians are more vulnerable to fatigue and error hard market driver liability insurance capacity is eroding the confluence of elevated risk profiles and larger losses has forced carriers to reevaluate their stance in the healthcare liability market weve seen markets pull back in a variety of fashions either completely exiting lines of business or reunderwriting their portfolio reconsidering the amount of capacity they are willing to expose and what rate they want to achieve coleman said unexpected larger losses drive reserve deficiency a reversal of a yearslong trend wherein healthcare liability insurers typically enjoyed reserve redundancy as the allocation of thirdparty capital increased in the property market over the past decade reinsurers redeployed their capital into casualty lines of business coleman said now that significant losses are developing insurers are seeing very low or negative roes that appear not to be sustainable which may lead to a greater reduction of capacity increasing loss values and greater exposures have certainly driven some of the decisions being made marketwide in terms of managing net capacity attachment points and premiums coleman said to prepare for changes risk managers need a reliable carrier what can risk managers do to prepare i would be very aware of the financial strength and diversity of my insurer understand their commitment to and expertise in this line of business and focusing on forging longterm relationships with them coleman said you want an insurer who is willing to work with you and has the capability to offer stability in terms conditions and pricing swiss re corporate solutions has been committed to the healthcare industry for over years providing healthcares signature liability protection medical malpractice insurance there has not been a time when we exited this line of business coleman said

inhouse claims professionals who understand that how a claim is handled can be as important as the outcome itself work closely with clients throughout the claim lifecycle and of course we ensure that policies are issued and claims are responded to in a timely manner coleman said after all what were selling is the promise to pay a claim with an aa rating from standard poors an a rating from am best

time and resources to combating it cheapair ceo jeff klee told motherboard in an email sspr a public relations firm that cheapair confirmed it was retaining also shared screenshots of the sort of posts std suggested it plans to make one is a tweet saying cheapair is a total fraud i have lost and they ignore my emails people stay away from cheapair at the time of writing the tweet has been retweeted over times and liked times but many if not all of those interactions appear to be from bot accounts motherboard found a slew of the accounts were created this month had no profile image or

successful mobile banking trojans responsible for stealing funds from hundreds of thousands of users worldwide but how did this unremarkable piece of malware become so prolific while asacub initially started life as a form of spyware in the first half of by the start of the following year the malware had shifted to stealing funds and banking information and has kept that focus ever since it proved to be a smart move for the attackers because by the middle of asacub had risen to become the most prolific form of mobile banking trojan in the world outperforming other prominent forms of banking malware including svpeng and faketoken in terms of sheer number of attacks to date asacub has infected over users almost all of whom are in russia although it has also hit victims across the former ussr as well as germany the united states and others according to researchers at kasperky lab whove examined the rise and continued success of the malware distribution of the malware has barely changed over the years with asacubs means of delivery coming via sms phishing messages which contain a link and ask the victim to view a photo or media message if the user clicks through to this theyre directed to a webpage that encourages them to download the supposed image but in fact downloads the apk for the trojan the malware can only be downloaded onto the android device if the user enables the installation of thirdparty apps from unknown sources once the installation process is up and running asacub asks the user for device administrator rights or permission to use accessibility services both of which provide the malicious app with the ability to carry out its illicit tasks see also what is malware everything you need to know about viruses trojans and malicious software in order to ensure the malware is granted these rights the request for permissions will repeatedly appear every few seconds even if the user attempts to reject or ignore it a tactic designed to ensure the victim gives into the demand once this request has been met the malware immediately sets itself as the default sms application in order to steal all incoming messages and send them and details of the sender to the attacker by setting itself as the default messaging app asacub can withdraw funds from phones running an application used by one of russias largest banks this banking application allows for money to be exchanged via sms and to steal money asacub sends another phishing message to the device asking for a transfer the malwares ability to read messages also means it can intercept text messages from the bank containing onetime passwords helping the attackers to steal from accounts that use additional security in addition asacub ensures the user cant check their mobile banking balance or change any settings because the permissions it has been given enables it to prevent the legitimate banking app from running on the phone the attacks might seem basic but they still work and kaspersky figures say asacub currently accounts for percent of mobile banking trojan attacks the example of the asacub trojan shows us that mobile malware can function for several years with minimal changes in its distribution pattern shishkova told zdnet one of the main reasons for this is that the human factor can be leveraged through social engineering smsmessages look like they are meant for a certain user so victims unconsciously click on fraudulent links in addition with regular change of domains from which the trojan is distributed catching it requires heuristic methods of detection she added however despite the prolific nature of asacub its relatively simple for users to avoid becoming a victim researchers suggest only downloading applications from official sources and warn users not to click on suspicious links of unknown origin read more on cyber crimeviruses and malware are bad news they can slow down your pc by mining cryptocurrency modifying important files and

cybersecurity solutions today released its midyear security roundup revealing that cybercriminals are moving away from attentiongrabbing ransomware attacks to more covert methods intended to steal money and valuable computing resources cryptojacking attempts are making the biggest impact so far this year trend micro recorded a percent increase in cryptocurrency mining detections in h compared to all of and a percent increase in detections versus h this indicates cybercriminals are shifting away from the quick payout of ransomware in favor of the slower behindthescenes approach of stealing computing power to mine digital currency the recent change in the threat landscape mirrors what weve seen for years cybercriminals will constantly shift their tools tactics and procedures ttps to improve their infection rates said jon clay director of global threat communications for trend micro standard spray and pray ransomware attacks and data breaches had become the norm so attackers changed their tactics to be more covert using entry vectors not previously seen or used extensively this means once again business leaders must evaluate their defenses to ensure sufficient protection is in place to stop the latest and most pressing threats another shift in the first half of the year is toward unusual malware types such as fileless macro and small file malware trend micro recorded a percent increase in detections of one particular small file malware tinypos compared to h which may be due to the increased ability of these malware types to circumvent defenses that employ only one type of security protection additionally the trend micro zero day initiative zdi published more than advisories in the first six months of based on this increase in advisories the zdi is able to predict what types of vulnerabilities will likely be used next in realworld attacks among the advisories this year the zdi purchased and disclosed twice as many scada vulnerabilities compared to the same time last year it security managers running these environments must stay alert to this growing threat especially as actors begin to perform destructive attacks rather than mere reconnaissance and

bossert wrote in a wall street journal oped published monday night that north korea was directly responsible for the wannacry ransomware attack and that pyongyang will be held accountable for it bossert said the administrations finding of responsibility is based on evidence and confirmed by other governments and private companies including the united kingdom and microsoft north korea has acted especially badly largely unchecked for more than a decade and its malicious behavior is growing more egregious wannacry was indiscriminately reckless he wrote bossert said the trump administration will continue to use its maximum pressure strategy to curb pyongyangs ability to mount attacks cyber or otherwise the wannacry attack struck more than nations in may locking up digital documents databases and other files and demanding a ransom for their release it battered britains national health service where the cyberattack froze computers at hospitals across the country closing emergency rooms and bringing medical treatment to a halt government offices in russia spain and several other countries were disrupted as were asian universities germanys national railway and global companies such as automakers nissan and renault the wannacry ransomware exploited a vulnerability in mostly older versions of microsofts windows operating system affected computers had generally not been patched with security fixes that would have blocked the attack security experts however traced the exploitation of that weakness back to the us national security agency it was part of a cache of stolen nsa cyberweapons publicly released by a group of hackers known as the shadow brokers microsoft president brad smith likened the theft to the us military having some of its tomahawk missiles stolen and argued that intelligence agencies should disclose such vulnerabilities rather than hoarding them wannacry came to a screeching halt thanks to enterprising work by a british hacker named marcus hutchins who discovered that the malwares author had embedded a kill switch in the code hutchins was able to trip that switch and the attack soon ended in an unusual twist hutchins was arrested months later by the fbi during a visit to the us he pleaded not guilty and now awaits trial on charges he created unrelated forms of malware the united states and south korea have accused north korea of launching a series of cyberattacks in recent years though the north has dismissed the accusations a south korean lawmaker in october said north korean hackers stole highly classified military documents that include ussouth korean wartime decapitation strike plans against the north korean leadership seouls defense ministry earlier said north korea was likely behind the hacking of the defense integrated data center which is the military data center where the information was kept in september last year but the defense ministry refused to confirm the nature of the information that was compromised south korea also last year accused north korea of hacking the personal data of more than million users of an online shopping site and dozens of email accounts used by government officials and journalists the united states in formally accused north korea of hacking sony pictures entertainment over the movie the interview a satirical film about a plot to assassinate north koreas leader south korea said in that north korea had a member cyberarmy dedicated to disrupting the souths government and military the figure was a sharp increase from a south korean estimate of such specialists baik taehyun spokesman for south koreas unification ministry which deals with matters related to north korea said monday that the seoul government was examining whether the north was behind hacking attacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in june about million in digital money was stolen in the hacks south korean officials said theres speculation in the south that north korean hackers are possibly targeting cryptocurrency like bitcoin to evade the heavy financial sanctions imposed over the countrys nuclear weapons and missiles program we are monitoring the bitcoinrelated issue we believe that north korea is currently engaging in various activities to evade sanctions and earn foreign currency baik saidshare get months of ps plus for xbox live gold for months under off norton

money without being caught is a big problem for successful cybercriminals they often have to get creative when cashing out or laundering the money they have stolen according to a security expert ziv mador head of security research at trustwave spiderlabs told the bbc that credit card thieves for example have limited time to profit because at some point the victim will put a stop on their card tens of thousands of stolen card numbers are traded daily on the underground markets that mr mador and his colleagues monitor with details taken from compromised websites or databases they can try to sell the card which is not big money because they only get a few dollars for each one he said instead he added they are more likely to use them to buy more valuable assets like iphones or macbooks which are popular because they tend to hold their value when resold they do not buy or so iphones at once he said they use a lot of different cards at different times mr mador said the crooks use randomisation tools to thwart antifraud systems that would spot if all the purchases even those made with different cards are being done on the same computer another cashing out technique uses gift cards from big retailers such as amazon and walmart image copyright reuters image caption apples iphones are often bought and resold by cyberthieves this technique involves buying the gift card with the stolen credit card and then offering it for sale at a big discount for example a customer may be able to buy a card for half price although they face the risk of it being cancelled if a retailer notices it was originally bought with a stolen credit card then there are the more creative scams that seek to use uber and other ridehailing firms to launder cash mr mador and others have seen adverts seeking drivers who can take part with spain and the us both popular locations for the fraud other places like moscow and st petersburg were temporarily unavailable they are looking for uber drivers for fraudulent payments people who can register for uber and do fake rides said mr mador the drivers account is used to launder the cash generated when stolen credit cards are used to pay for the fictitious journeys and they get a cut of the money as a payment it is these markets that form the backbone of the cybercrime world said dr mike mcguire a criminologist from the university of surrey who has studied this shadowy community we took a holistic look at the criminal economy and then we could see where the flows of money were going he told the bbc some was laundered via banks and other wellestablished routes long used by criminal gangs who increasingly have been finding ways to use newer technological methods dr mcguires research suggests billions in criminal cash passes through underground markets each year some of that is just thieves selling to thieves but other methods involve the sale of drugs and other contraband through conversations with convicted crooks and the police who pursue them dr mcguire said it was clear that some were involved in the trade for very mundane reasons its a very human set of activities that these people are involved in he said about were just using their revenues to pay their mortgages and their bills others those who were making a lot of money had got involved in oldfashioned ostentatious spending he told the bbc a lot of them are converting their money to assets and investing in them to acquire status paper trail banks are getting better at spotting money laundering that uses property and fake corporations said rob horton from baes applied intelligence division that helps financial firms spot fraud this is not straightforward work he explained because the crooks worked hard to obscure their ownership of the bogus firms but he said detailed longterm analysis of the information shared by front companies can help unpick the relationships we will often find the contact details and registration addresses for these facilitators are the same across dozens of applications he said thats because its very hard to genuinely create that many completely new corporate or individual identities image copyright reuters image caption one money laundering effort sought to recruit uber drivers as a result they tend to reuse the same artefacts industry efforts to get lots of legitimate financial organisations sharing data about the organisations behind payments and purchases were also helping to uncover the front organisations he added it takes a network to defeat a network that longterm datadriven approach is also helping banks to pick out the lowlevel recruits some criminals are using as mules said kedar samant cofounder of fraudspotting firm simility mules are used by a lot of criminal gangs to get at cash generated by other means often ransomware attacks or phishing campaigns some gangs approach people who have done manual lowpaid work abroad and offer to buy access to the bank account they set up when in that country old school fraud detection systems would struggle to spot cash laundered through this route because they were very brittle mr samant said they tended to look for anomalous behaviour rather than consider the context around the account how it is used over time and where cash goes that long view was becoming crucial because many criminals were happy to take their time to learn the best ways to defraud a bank by testing it with short bursts of attacks that they then pull back from to see if the loss has been noticed your customers may come and go but fraudsters tend to be very loyal mr samant said thats because it takes time to learn a banks systems and how they can get away with the crimesin terms of existential risk how would you consider the coming technological singularity what about the future of automated drone combat or the possibility of nuclear annihilation or biological weapons now what about a foreign cyberattack if youre like most people the latter seems to be the most ridiculous concept and the one least worthy of concern its easy for us to imagine the world getting destroyed by nuclear weapons because weve already seen two of them dropped on cities and weve got some questionable leaders in charge of policing their use and its easy for us to picture an ai takeover because weve seen it over and over again in pop culture hard fork hard fork hard fork but for some reason we dont take cyber threats seriously enough and if we want to be adequately prepared we need to change that fast the possibility of a cyberattack credit shutter stock i want to start by acknowledging the true possibility of a cyberattack compared to the possibility of other types of existential risks the chances of a nuclear strike are much lower than most people expect while nuclear arsenals are still numerous and safety standards in some cases leave something to be desired consider this its been more than years since the atomic bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki and in that time weve had the tensest most aggressive nuclear standoff imaginable with the ussr yet despite that animosity and availability no further strike was made and the possibility of selfassured destruction through nuclear winter inhibits any nation from making a strike the probability of a malicious ai takeover is also low if for no other reason than our limited understanding its highly unlikely that any competent ai would develop sufficiently malicious intentions and even a paperclip maximizer with sufficient capabilities to be an existential threat is many years to many decades beyond our reach even in the most optimistic estimates but the threat of a cyberattack is real and already unfolding consider the wannacry ransomware attack in may which affected more than computers in countries across the world demanding bitcoin payments up to devices in national health service hospitals in england and scotland alone were affected including blood storage refrigerators and mri scanners putting patients lives in jeopardy and the total cost of the attack is estimated to be up to billion usd its suspected that north korea was behind the attack but even if the country isnt affiliated with it this incident proves just how imminent a threat cyberattacks can be the existential risk the probability of occurrence is grounds for concern but the severity of a wellexecuted attack should be even more troubling the most intuitive cause for concern is monetary more than percent of all currency in the world exists only in digital and nontangible forms if a single financial institution is disrupted it could wipe out billions of dollars in assets and undermine consumer faith in fiat currency the disruption here could affect entire countries economies and for anywhere from hours to months but the wannacry attack exposes an even more important vulnerability healthcare our hospitals rely on technology for the vast majority of patient treatments whether its documenting the progression of a case or literally keeping a patient alive one sophisticated attack on a hospital could jeopardize hundreds to thousands of lives and thats not even considering the possibility of a cyberattack targeting our utilities and infrastructure our society is heavily dependent on being able to access water electricity and food very easily and without these basic necessities millions of lives could be in jeopardy consider the northeast blackout of which wiped out power in the midwestern united states and ontario for just hours in some areas and a day or two in others this relatively short smallscale outage resulted in an estimated deaths and it was all rooted in a single software bug from an akron ohio company if an unintentional cyber vulnerability was enough to cause this much havoc a coordinated malicious attack would be orders of magnitude more consequential accessibility and ease wars require the approval of highranking authorities and the coordination of millions of people ai would hypothetically require the cooperation of some of the worlds most brilliant minds and many years of work even the worst effects of global climate change will only unfold after many years and continued worldwide abuse of the environment but in the world of cybercrime extreme damage can be done by a bored teenager in their bedroom back in when he was years old a hacker going by the name mafiaboy shut down sites operated by yahoo cnn ebay etrade and others for several hours and while that seems innocuous it resulted in an estimated billion in total losses and shows just how vulnerable even our bestguarded digital assets really are why cyberattacks dont seem credible ive demonstrated why cyber threats are so devastatingly powerful so why arent more people taking them seriously part of the problem is the public perception of hacking most people imagine a lone computer nerd temporarily taking down a major companys site in exchange for several thousand dollars then moving on or at worst a major data breach like ones affecting target or ashley madison affecting everyday consumers but only temporarily and in limited capacity wannacry is the only largescale potentiallynationallymotivated attack weve seen and even that got limited press exposure compared to other hacks and data breaches were also guilty of assuming that the baseline resources we rely on to live including food water electricity and yes the internet are going to be there no matter what somehow its easier to imagine someone sending a nuclear bomb to wipe out a city than it is imagining these supply lines drying up from a coordinated cyberattack taking action i dont have a solution for this problem other than encouraging us all to think critically about the real nature of cyberthreats because a cyberattack can hit anything including big companies hospitals government websites or power plants we need governmental institutions private companies and organizations to work together to better guard their technology and by extension us proactive defense ongoing monitoring and redundant backups are the only ways we can maximize our chances of surviving such an attack this post is part of our contributor series the views expressed are the authors own and not necessarily shared by tnw read next instagram opens its account verification process to everyonewhy schools are prime targets for data breaches copyright nexstar broadcasting inc all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed video providence ri wpri breach attempts including phishing emails and ransomware threats happen constantly at schools and universities according to nicholas tella the director of information security and adjunct professor in the college of engineering and design at johnson wales university we have to keep an open environment tella explained we cant block certain sites and we cant block students from going to certain sites whereas a bank or a financial institution could i call it a target rich environment for the bad guys he added they have everything they have a name a date of birth a social security number and a home address indepth back to school coverage federal law protects the privacy of student records and schools have systems in place to protect that data but breaches can happen if someone does something as simple as clicking on a link they shouldnt the key is getting enterprise data solutions that are storing the student data that have the necessary security in place to meet all of the federal state and local guidelines that dictate how that data should be maintained tella said the second step is training your faculty and staff on how to handle that data in a recent report to the us congress the kentucky department of education said its schools faced more than billion breach attempts in the rhode island department of education ride told eyewitness news it does not track similar information but said data security is a priority while schools are protecting students data parents can also help kids protect their digital footprints its about creating a digital profile everything you do follows you tella cautioned unfortunately if youre capturing some silly moment that youre in it could be used against you down the line tella said parents should also consider installing remote wipe technology on family devices if a device is lost or stolen you will have the ability to delete the personal information thats on ita mishandled disclosure process saw proofofconcept code for a windows zeroday flaw released on twitter but microsoft has no patch available a selfdescribed retired vulnerability researcher who goes by the handle sandboxescaper announced the windows zeroday on twitter on aug complete with proofofconcept poc code hosted on github but didnt notify microsoft beforehand the flaw is part of the windows task scheduler and it can allow an attacker to obtain system privileges according to the cert coordination center certcc advisory the windows task scheduler contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the advanced local procedure call alpc interface we have confirmed that the public exploit code works on bit windows and windows server systems will dormann vulnerability analyst for certcc wrote in the advisory compatibility with other windows versions may be possible with modification of the publiclyavailable exploit source code dormann also confirmed on twitter that although the poc released by sandboxescaper was designed to be a windows zeroday and affect bit systems the exploit would also work on bit systems with minor tweaks craig young computer security researcher at tripwire based in portland ore noted that the windows zeroday would allow the caller to manipulate file permissions of protected system files this can be used to overwrite system libraries with malicious code to hijack windows with this published exploit code it is trivial for malware to take complete control of the system after the malware has been loaded young wrote via email without a privilege escalation bug like this the malware would be dependent on users clicking through access control alerts or entering administrator credentialsransomware attacks are proliferating the consequences to business can be huge here are things you should do before it strikes the risk of a ransomware attack is rising with the prevalence and ease of access to criminal toolkits often referred to as ransomware as a service or raas targeting a single organisation on multiple fronts is only becoming easier and attacks can be made even more effective when combined with social engineering tactics the cost to businesses can stretch into the hundreds of millions the shipping giant cosco is the latest company to succumb to a high profile attack with the nhss wannacry shutdown among the bestknown incidents many organisations are asking how to prevent ransomware no security strategy is ironclad but there are a variety of preventative steps to take which can mitigate both the risk and impact of a ransomware attack get serious about patching many ransomware attacks that have made headlines have used relatively wellknown vulnerabilities and organisations that have strong patching regimes have avoided infection the challenge is that the ransomware as a service business model employed by cybercriminals seeks to weaponise security holes at a faster rate to increase potential success and their profits while no zero days exploits have yet made it into a viable ransomware attack experts believe its only a matter of time before they do patching can be hindered by change controls which can affect users and production systems for this reason a pragmatic balanced approach is required between fastpatching and reliability another reason why rapidrecovery systems are necessary and why patch compatibility with backup systems should be the first thing on patch checklists protect your disaster recovery plans a commonly encountered issue after ransomware hits is complete loss of the system blueprints and disaster recovery plans which is a risk for any digitalonly documents the lesson here is the importance of ensuring full access to comprehensive dr and recovery plans remains in place under all circumstances good backup software vendors offer services for secure offsite storage that can help if you have never experienced a massive outage from malware its hard to imagine and failure to understand whats needed will mean outages continue for much longer than necessary days or weeks not just hours defence in depth due to its nature stopping all malware is practically impossible so spotting it early is the next best thing desktop computers are the usual entry point so modern antivirus technology staff training scanning gateways and regularly patched properly configured firewalls are needed as a minimum its also worth looking beyond traditional security vendors for additional protection increasingly backup software can play a part in the detection and alerting of ransomware attacks especially when it covers both desktops and production systems look to ai and automation to increase your protection many vendors are turning to ai to help in the security space and also in backup both critical parts of your cybermalware defences backup systems for example will look at changed data and files every day and by using ai to understand what kinds of changes are normal and which arent it can send reliable alerts on suspected incidents in addition it can also automatically extend retention so that older backups are retained until the anomaly has been checked out advanced reporting means valuable gap analysis can provide insight as to where your recovery processes might fail and by leveraging ai you can easily reorganise backup methods and schedules for even the most complex hybridcloud estate putting you in the best place for recovery become recovery ready a significant malware attack is a gamechanger system dependencies kickin and create recoveryroadblocks communications go down plans evaporate and business recovery priorities shift like desert sands you may even need to build a new datacentre to recover to as with cosco and others its imperative to have a robust backup system with its own defences failure to do this means cracking the encryption keys or paying the ransom becomes your only option assuming that destruction alone is not the purpose of the attack however recovery readiness is not just about creating secure backups it relies on meeting required restore goals in the right order and system groups and to different targets even the cloud while all around is in chaos recovery readiness is as much about the support you can get when you need it as it is about having a reliable backup system and a complete plan that is regularly reviewed and tested one only has to take a casual review of the tech media to see the industry concern about this present and ongoing threat underpinned by organised crime and rogue states not to mention the part that western governments play these threats transcend modern availability systems so if you havent reviewed your backup systems in a while its time you did you might be pleasantly surprised to see just how much has changedasigras latest attempt to combat sophisticated malware that dumps ransomware on backup systems has taken the form of new hardware released in partnership with ixsystems the asigra truenas backup appliance unveiled this week at vmworld combines the cloud backup software vendors latest cloud backup evolved solution with ixsystems truenas storage hardware the two companies customers many of which they share have been requesting this partnership and an ensuing product that combined the two vendors expertise brett davis executive vicepresident of ixsystems told cdn weve had customers using both truenas and asigra in concert for many years so it was really their request saying hey it would be great if you could merge these two technologies together so we dont have to buy them separately for us it has extended the simplicity for deploying backup solutions for customers said davis what weve also done is a create a solution that integrates asigra into the ui as a service the free communitysupported version of truenas called freenas is highly popular in open source circles and according to a spokesperson for ixsystems canada ranks th in the world for most downloads per country but it was the enterprisegrade version of freenas that caught the attention of asigra said eran farajun executive vicepresident of asigra the torontobased company was planning to develop its second integrated appliance but it quickly became clear the ixsystems had all of the new functions they were looking for such as improved scalability and instant snapshot and replication capabilities it was a natural fit he said this is the next generation appliance asigra truenas backup appliance provide capacities from tb to pb and includes a futureproof bit scale up file system designed for continuous use asigras latest backup software which offers protection against ransomware that lays dormant in backup systems comes included in the new product in the last months ransomware has started to attack backup software products explained farajun indicating that cyber criminals have found a way around peoples attempts to protect themselves from traditional ransomware infections simply put a virus lands on a network sits dormant for three to six months then when a company backs up its systems it unknowingly dumps the virus into its backup repository thats when the virus detonates asigra can detect infections in the backup streams and in the old backups it can then eliminate those infections before they detonate and launch more attacks in the future the asigra truenas backup appliance is available now through asigra partnersindustry insight better solutions for ransomware recovery the march samsam ransomware attack against atlanta disabled more than a third of the citys necessary programs encrypting close to percent of the workload and data deemed mission critical as of june the bill for the recovery phase that followed had topped million considerably more than the ransom originally sought by the hackers this recent encounter with ransomware ironically came on the heels of reports from isaca and other cybersecurity groups that the pace of ransomware attacks had slowed from the preceding year atlantas experience reenergized concerns about attacks on local state and federal government entities ransomware tends to be delivered as a payload by other types of malware many attacks are enabled by phishing or social engineering wherein users are tricked into either opening email attachments or clicking on links that direct their browsers to download ransomware code at an appointed time the malicious app encrypts all data in the system to decrypt the data the victim must obtain a key from the hackers via a ransom payment in response to these attacks business and government organizations have largely focused on two approaches user training to prevent successful phishing and detection scanning to identify malware code already in systems so that it can be removed before it activates both approaches have their problems training is limited in efficacy because users tend to lose interest over time hypervigilance can be exhausting especially when no threats are apparent intrusion detection systems also have limits dhss einstein albert and other cybersecurity intrusion detection and prevention systems offer varying degrees of capability in identifying malware but the changing nature of attack vectors variants of malware render most detection methods less than airtight the old adage about security remains true attacks are asymmetrical security folks need to be successful all the time while the bad guys only need to succeed once to breach security and do their damage agencies need technologies that can limit the impact of ransomware in those instances when preventative measures fail a class of enterprise storage called object storage offers two functions that could provide an answer versioning and write once read many worm capabilities versioning a feature of object storage systems that retains a copy of a file every time a change is made refers to a process wherein data is never overwritten rather whenever the data is updated a new version is created the old version remains in storage and can be retrieved at any time when a ransomware attack encrypts data the information can be restored from a unencrypted version this protection is not percent ironclad in theory malware could delete the old versions though no known ransomware does this worm technology provides even more security because once written data cannot be deleted or modified until a prespecified time has elapsed like a timerlock on a vault the data is protected from all attackers even a malicious employee since ransomware works by encrypting data placing data in storage that does not permit any alteration thwarts a ransomware attack worm storage can help with malware detection as well other approaches such as data replication might copy the malware code too setting the stage for a recurrence of the attack in the protected infrastructure with worm storage data is not replicated so that possibility is effectively negated more work is required to design a truly ransomwareproof storage environment but the worm and versioning capabilities found in many object storage systems suggest the beginning of a practical response to the ransomware threat object storage can be readily deployed as a backup target with popular enterprise backup and archiving solutions such as veritas commvault and rubrik making it a straightforward addition to an agencys data protection workflow without more robust data protection agencies may have to prepare for the worst even setting up a bitcoin account from which to pay ransoms as one security consultant joked at a recent conference the quip failed to elicit even a nervous laugh the audience understood the desperate need for more practical solutions than capitulation

allows it managers to work out precisely which files and folders have been scrambled and roll back just the affected documents and data to the point before the extortionware hit this is were told supposed to be more efficient for businesses than restoring all files on a companywide basis on the one hand it means downtime due to wiping and restoring systems from backups is reduced on the other hand you might think a deep networkwide cleanandrestore would be better as it would ensure no trace of the malware remains alaskan borough dusts off the typewriters after ransomware crims pwn entire network read more beyond data loss opportunity costs and reputational risks downtime resulting from ransomware attacks can inflict real harm on customers in any industry including healthcare or public safety where the consequences of any delay can be catastrophic said billy ho vp of enterprise products at blackberry organizations need to have a strong culture of security to minimize the risk of an attack something that our cybersecurity consulting team has been supporting for the last several years and in a worstcase scenario its critical that organizations also have a layered defense model in place and an enterprise technology stack that is designed with the inevitable breach in mind blackberry claims its technology can handle backups going back an unlimited amount of time as well as working at an individual file level to avoid wiping data on staff machines that werent hijacked the system will work on windows pcs macos macs android and ios devices and the few holdouts still using the blackberry mobile os of course there are various competing antiransomware defenses available from paidfor solutions in antivirus packages to operating systemlevel protections in windows to free tools such as ransomwhere for macs and regular organized offline backups are rather nice too sponsored following bottomlines journey to the hybrid cloudblackberry has unveiled new ransomware recovery software at the black hat security conference this week that it claims will help organisations to quickly recover from cyberattacks announced as part of its nextgeneration blackberry workspaces content collaboration platform the ransomware recovery feature is said to help contain and limit the damage of ransomware attacks by freezing the accounts of affected users using the software the administrator can check user logs to pinpoint exactly what workspaces folders and files have been affected and selectively roll affected users files and folders back to preattack versions without restrictions on how far back it can recover the ability to precisely remove just the infected files in this way ought to help organisations avoid the loss of work and productivity that often accompany systemwide recovery mechanisms blackberry claims that this new tool will prove valuable because ransomware attacks are on the rise once again following a period in which cyber attackers tended to focus on propagating cryptocurrency miners in order to cashin on the boom in value of bitcoin monero and other cryptocurrencies cryptocurrency mining was also seen as lower risk beyond data loss opportunity costs and reputational risks downtime resulting from ransomware attacks can inflict real harm on customers in any industry including health care or public safety where the consequences of any delay can be catastrophic said blackberrys executive vice president of enterprise products billy ho organisations need to have a strong culture of security in order to minimise the risk of an attack something that our cybersecurity consulting team has been supporting for the last several years in a worstcase scenario its critical that organisations also have a layered defense model in place and an enterprise technology stack that is designed with the inevitable breach in mind the new ransomware recovery feature will be available in the blackberry workspaces collaborate and secure plus editions at no extra cost the firm will also be demonstrating the new tech at the blackberrysecurity summits in london on september and new york on octobervictims of a new form of ransomware that appeared just weeks ago can now retrieve their encrypted files without having to pay a bitcoin ransom discovered in early august ransomwarrior appears to be the work of hackers working out of india if the inclusion of have a good day with the love from india on the ransom note is to be believed the filelocking malware targets microsoft windows users and is delivered to victims via an executable named a big presentexe which if run will encrypt files with a thbec extension victims are shown a ransom note and given instructions to visit a dark web address in order to pay an unspecified ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency image check point the attackers offer victims the opportunity to decrypt two files for free but the note also reminds victims that if they dont pay the ransom they wont get their files back victims are also intimidated into not reporting the attack to the police with the attackers claiming law enforcement cant help you see also what is ransomware everything you need to know about one of the biggest menaces on the web researchers at check point analysed ransomwarrior and found it to be the work of seemingly inexperienced attackers and were able to retrieve the decryption keys from the malware check point succeeded due to the weak encryption used by the ransomware which is a stream cipher that uses a key randomly generated from hardcoded keys in the ransomwarrior binary code as the keys index is saved locally on the victims computer to provide the means of unlocking the files researchers have been able to build a decryption tool for anyone infected by ransomwarrior while many cyber criminals have switched focus to cryptocurrency mining malware as a stealthier and less risky means of acquiring bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ransomware still remains a prominent cyber threat instead of deploying mass spam campaigns in an effort to infect as many users as possible the most successful ransomware campaigns have developed new tactics in many cases the attackers put time and effort into compromising whole networks before eventually pulling the trigger on the ransomware infection its this form of targeted campaign that helped one cyber criminal operation make over m and which continue to net an additional each month read more on cyber crimecryptocurrency scams replacing ransomware as attackers fave cryptojacking miners and fileless malware see biggest growth in first half of the incidence of cryptocurrency mining malware continues to skyrocket as the bad guys refocus their efforts away from ransomware in favor of the easy money that cryptocurrency offers them the latest evidence of the trend came by way of a new report released earlier this week that examined attack data for the first half of cryptojacking numbers dominated the reports highlights as researchers from trend micro showed that the volume of cryptomining attacks for the first half of the year was almost double the number of similar attacks during all of comparing likeforlike the cryptocurrency mining detections increased more than ninefold in the first half of compared with the first half of meantime the number of ransomware families declined in this years first half compared with the second half of last year in addition ransomware growth slowed considerably only inching forward by about from the first half of the year compared with the last half of the recent change in the threat landscape mirrors what weve seen for years cybercriminals will constantly shift their tools tactics and procedures to improve their infection rates said jon clay director of global threat communications for trend micro in a statement meantime the report showed that unusual malware types such as fileless smallfile and macro malware are all seeing significant upticks this corresponds to a different report out this week from sentinelone that shows fileless attacks rose in the first half of and in fact the trends of fileless malware and cryptocurrency mining malware have been seen to cross over as of late late last month researchers with kaspersky reported the growing prevalence of powerghost a fileless malware family that preys on corporate networks to siphon their machines compute power as they explained powerghost creators combine the cryptojacking capability of any other malicious miner with the super stealthy characteristics of a fileless malware like any miner powerghost uses your computing resources to generate cryptocurrency this reduces server and other device performance as well as significantly accelerates wear and tear which leads to replacement costs however compared with most such programs powerghost is more difficult to detect because it doesnt download malicious files to the device some experts believe we will see more cryptomining botnets trending in this direction as corporate systems and networks tend to offer attacker a veritable open buffet of compute power once they can find a way to ingratiate their malware onto machines the latest powerghost malware shows there is renewed interest in creating botnets from enterprise workstations and servers explained sean newman director of product management at corero network security earlier this month he said this is in contrast to a lot of recent botnet attack activity around iot devices with the significantly higherpowered cpus in these devices compared to iot its not surprising that they are now the target for computeintensive cryptomining activities he added related content black hat europe returns to

the conference and to register ericka chickowski specializes in coverage of information technology and business innovation she has focused on information security for the better part of a decade and regularly writes about the security industry as a contributor to dark reading view full bioransomware is a growing plague weve been covering frequently here on techgenix many of my colleagues in the it profession have had many sleepless nights worrying about the potential for disaster their company could face should a ransomware attack against them succeed but is ransomware really such a big problem and are there any steps you can take as an administrator to protect your organization and stop ransomware attacks before they are successful i discussed this with security expert oddvar moe and we both agreed that a good starting point is to make use of the many protection features that are already built into the windows operating system and microsoft office platform oddvar is an experienced fellow who has worked as an it pro for more than years he is a microsoft mvp in the area of cloud and datacenter management and he currently works at advania in norway as a technical architect with a focus on security testing cloud services and windows enterprise security hes also a microsoft certified trainer and a giaccertified penetration tester gpen and he has a passion for security and loves to share his knowledge either through his blog and by writing articles speaking at conferences and on social media what follows is an edited excerpt from my discussion of this subject with oddvar on how you can stop ransomware understanding the problem you cant stop ransomware unless you know what it is so i started by asking oddvar to explain what the actual problem is that we call ransomware he replied as follows many companies have been hit with ransomware and the problem is increasing it is very difficult to stay ahead of this problem and be proactive about it companies invest a lot of money on security products but still ransomware finds its way into client computers i have seen a lot of different approaches on how to be prepared for the next wave of ransomware there are a few lowhanging fruits that you can easily enable in your environment to make it more difficult for ransomware to infect computers and i will go over them in this article but in order to prevent something you will need to understand it first a user normally gets infected either through email with a malicious attachment or links that they click on the attachment will normally either contain a pdf with an exploit or if it is an office document it can contain macro code that executes something evil when the user opens the attachment the attackers code starts to run and ransomware gets executed if the user receives a link and they click on it they will often be sent to something called an exploit kit an exploit kit is a tool that cybercriminals use to autoexploit clients that visit the page a typical exploit kit will enumerate what version of flash adobe reader and java that is installed and give the computer a working exploit in order to get the ransomware executed on the machine when the ransomware gets executed on the machine it will normally contact a server controlled by the cybercriminals to get a key to start encrypting files furthermore the ransomware typically deletes volume shadow copy snapshots and then it enumerates all your local drives and mapped drives and starts to encrypt the content on them newer versions of ransomware also scan the local area network for shares that the user has write access to and starts to encrypt them as well after the ransomware is done encrypting the files it will make sure that the user gets notified about how to get the files unencrypted again by paying identifying mitigations to stop ransomware having explained the basics of a typical ransomware attack i went on by asking oddvar to go over some simple mitigation steps we can implement as administrators to stop ransomware in its tracks an easy mitigation is to disable execution of macros in office if your company for some reason needs to run macros from your office documents you can set the settings to only allowed signed macros that way the company needs to digital sign every macro they use but it will make the execution of macros safer in office there is a new setting that will prevent the execution of macros on content that has arrived from the internet i have explained that in detail on my blog here in short if you have office you need to enable this setting there is no reason why you should not enable it all of the office macro settings are managed through group policy and the latest admxadm files can be downloaded here i asked oddvar what else one could do besides disabling macros to protect ones windows pcs from the accidental execution of downloaded ransomware applocker immediately came to mind another great mitigation is to use whitelisting of executables with the use of applocker a quick way of getting started with this is to install a computer with all the software that your company uses and use the applocker in group policy to import executable list from that machine that way you will have a standard list of allowed applications in your enterprise if malware is executed on your computer it will not be able to do that due to the applocker policy applocker will only allow execution of the applications you allow applocker can prevent a lot of malware and unwanted executables and i highly recommend that you implement this technical documentation of applocker on windows and windows server can be found here office advanced threat protection formerly called exchange online advanced threat protection is another tool we identified as essential to stop ransomware we both agreed that if you have your mail flow through the office cloud then you need to implement this feature of microsofts exchange and office plans oddvar says that with it you have a better chance of preventing new ransomware campaigns before they reach your client computers windows defender exploit guard which is built into windows version and later is another essential safeguard microsoft provides customers for safeguarding against ransomware and other forms of malware this builtin windows feature also replaces the earlier enhanced mitigation experience toolkit emet that microsoft developed for windows and made available as a free download its still available for download though by the time youre reading this article it will have just reached its end of life while oddvar and i agreed that emet has been a useful tool against malware the online world has become a lot more dangerous since windows s heyday as the microsoft security research defense team explained here for a good explanation of how windows defender exploit guard compares with emet see this article on the windows it pro center needless to say this makes upgrading your pcs to windows a nobrainer if you want to stay secure nowadays dont forget your backups i ended my discussion with oddvar by asking him if there were any other best practices administrators should adhere to in order to protect their environments from ransomware he said the most important tip you will ever get is to make sure you have backups of your data i know this is probably selfexplanatory for many but i have seen many customers that actually dont have good enough backup of their systems and when they got infected with ransomware they had big problems there are of course many other important things you need to do to prevent infection of ransomware things like patching all software removing local administrator rights updating antivirus signatures controlling user access to the file shares and educating your users one of the most difficult tasks is to find out where the user has write access to in your network remember that if the user can write to a file so can the ransomware if the user gets infected to automate that tiresome job i created a script that checks the users access on the network that i named ransomware simulator the script will scan your lan for shares both normal shares and hidden and enumerate if the user has write access to it the script will then output this to a report file that you can have as documentation the script can be found on my blog this is excellent advice backups wont stop ransomware but they will help you recover from a successful attack hopefully these tips and tools will help you keep your organizations information assets safe and stop ransomware attacks before they start read nexta former microsoft network engineer will be spending a sojourn behind bars after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering raymond odigie uadiale was this week given an month sentence and three years supervised release after he agreed to a plea deal that saw him cop to a conspiracy charge in exchange for a second count of substantive money laundering being dropped the yearold uadiale had been charged in the southern florida us district court for his role in the reveton ransomware operation posing as a combination of ransomware and scareware reveton presented itself as a piece of law enforcement software telling the user they had downloaded illegal material and demanding the payment of a fine in order to restore access this was a sophisticated scheme to conceal the proceeds of a particularly insidious type of ransomware said us attorney benjamin greenberg on monday by claiming to originate from law enforcement agencies reveton not only victimized computer users it also exploited the agencies in whose names the ransomware claimed to be acting uadiale who was a student at florida international university at the time the crimes occurred in and was said to have received payments from victims in the form of prepaid debit cards then using the liberty reserve digital currency he transferred the plundered money into accounts controlled by himself and a coconspirator an unnamed distributor in the uk oh fore putts sake golf org pga bunkered up

payments raymond uadiale played an essential role in an international criminal operation that victimized unsuspecting americans by infecting their computers with malicious ransomware said assistant us attorney general brian benczkowski this conviction and sentence is another demonstration of the department of justices commitment to prosecuting cybercriminals and shutting down the networks they use to launder their criminal proceeds during the lull that came between committing the crime and getting indicted for the crime uadiale occupied himself by moving to washington state and getting a job with microsoft as a network engineer at the time he was indicted uadiale was living in the seattle suburb of maple valley microsoft has no comment on the case sponsored following bottomlines journey to the hybrid clouda former microsoft engineer has been given an month prison sentence after being found guilty of laundering money acquired from reveton ransomware victims the us department of justice doj said on tuesday that raymond odigie uadiale of maple valley washington pleaded guilty to cashing out payments made by victims of reveton the ransomware in question executes on pcs and encrypts system files a message is then shown on the home screen which claims that the user has violated federal law and downloaded illegal content as the message utilizes the fbi logo users may be frightened enough to pay the fine in order to regain access to their pc cnet amazon and microsoft bring alexa and cortana to each others devices this tactic appears to have worked well for the reveton operators who demanded that victims pay by way of a greendot moneypak as at the time in to bitcoin btc was not a common payment method once purchased victims would be instructed to enter the account number into the fbi home screen according to the indictment filed with the engineers plea agreement acquired by bleeping computer uadiale then laundered the moneypak funds into cash by using prepaid debit cards the engineer kept a percentage as payment and then sent the rest on to a reveton ransomware operator known as kng according to prosecutors the distributor of whom uadiale sent in liberty

serious consequences it is important to note however that uadiale was not in the employ of microsoft at the time of the scheme instead the engineer was a graduate student at florida international university between and the time in which reveton made the rounds previous and related coveragethis could mark yet another reinvention for the venuslocker group which has mostly been focused on cryptomining this year the venuslocker group appears to be back hatching a fresh gandcrab ransomware campaign so to speak using the egg niche file type the emails with egg attachments are meant to specifically take aim at south korean users trend micro researchers who first observed the offensive campaign in early august and posted about it today noted that the attachments are being used to deliver the gandcrab v ransomware the firm said the rash of emails uses ecommerce violation lures for instance a common subject line reads fair trade commission notice of investigation of violation of ecommerce transaction in english by way of background egg egg is a compressed archive file format that would seem exotic in most places around the globe but in south korea its the default format much akin to zip files in the us it was developed by a south korean company called estsoft in as part of its multiformat compression utility alzip even now egg files can only be uncompressed using the alzip tool many south korean users might find it odd if an archived file was sent to them by a friend or colleague in an archive file format other than egg said independent security researcher graham cluley trend micro researcher donald castillo in a post monday cited further evidence that the operators behind the spam are specifically going after south korean users the use of the specifically south korean alphabet hangul in the spam mails subject body and filename attachment in the trend micro analysis of the campaign the eggs are most definitely rotten filled with three files bent on malicious intent there are two shortcut lnk files that are disguised to appear as documents and an executable that disappears once the user decompresses the egg file the hidden executable carries the gandcrab payload it unpacks once a user clicks on either one of the two files that purport to be the documents this is an example of the shift of ransomware actors moving to more targeted campaigns than the traditional sprayandpray technique used in the past said trend micros jon clay director of global threat communications told threatpost utilizing phishing email techniques that use multiple files hidden files and a unique and interesting subject to entice the victims into clicking on the weaponized attachments allow the threat actors behind this campaign to likely improve their infection rates as for attribution within the lnk files venuslockerkoreanexe is inscribed which could mean that the venuslocker group was behind the distribution of spam mails said castillo venuslocker also has been spotted in the past using egg archives as well as the same hiddenfile technique and two decoy shortcut files that said clay said that a different group could be using the file name and the venuslocker approach as a smokescreen to throw off any investigators if venuslocker is indeed the threat actor it would mark yet another reinvention for the group venuslocker has a long history of targeting south korean users via phishing campaigns usually distributing its own proprietary ransomware last december however it was observed changing tactics following broader trends in the threat landscape to ditch ransomware for cryptomining in that campaign it went after users to implant monero mining malware switching back to ransomware now also follows global trends data from trend micro shows that gandcrab was the secondhighest detected ransomware family globally from march to july despite its commandandcontrol servers being seized by romanian police and europol in march the criminals behind gandcrab quickly tweaked the malware after the takedown to keep ransomware payments coming in the group has been staying profitable and staying onestep ahead of white hats by adopting a unique highly agile malware development approach in any event the attack is notable because it reinforces the recent change weve seen whereby ransomware actors have shifted to more targeted socially engineered email campaigns to improve their infection rates said clayby fred donovan august health management concepts hmc recently experienced a ransomware attack that quickly turned into a healthcare data breach in an aug letter attorneys for hmc informed the new hampshire attorney general that it discovered on july a server it used to share files with its clients was infected by ransomware hmc said it paid the attackers for the decryption key which they provided hmc decrypted the data without impact on the healthcare management services it provides to clients however hmc then discovered on july that the attackers were inadvertently provided a file containing personal information including names social security numbers and health insurance plan data on ibu members hmc explained that it provides chronic condition management to ibu inlandboatmens united of the pacific national benefit funds hmc did not explain how the file was inadvertently provided to the attackers it also did not say how many individuals were affected beyond the four new hampshire residents covered by the letter read more dermatology clinics see rash of healthcare data breaches coveware a ransomware recovery firm suggested that an encrypted file may have been sent to the attackers to demonstrate that they indeed could decrypt the file if the ransom was paid the attackers responded by sending back the decrypted file in this case the proof file contained sensitive healthcare data this oversight was obviously a mistake but it materially exacerbated the severity of the breach coveware judged hmc notified ibu about the breach ibu then requested that hmc notify those affected as well as regulators on its behalf to help prevent this type of incident from occurring again hmc is adding enhanced security protocols to its current server including removing access to the server through remote desktop protocol it also is migrating its server to another cloud computing service which will provide additional security hmc said in its letter to the nh attorney general post office found box of clinics medical records in house gordon schanzlin new vision institute reported to ocr on aug

impacted by the breacha vermont businesss computer system was attacked by hackers and held for ransom it may sound like a movie plot but ransomware attacks like these are on the rise according to their internet crime report last year the fbi received complaints identified as ransomware the adjusted losses from the attacks was over million an example of a ransomware attack is software that downloads to your computer encrypts your data and then demands money to get it back its technological extortion essentially and thats what happened to wendells furniture in colchester at the end of last month our servers crashed and when our it guy came to take care of the problem i asked him how the patient was doing and he just got kind of an ashen look on his face and he just shook his head and i knew we were in trouble said ryan farrell the vice president of wendells furniture farrell says in their nearly years of business theyve never had this type of cybersecurity attack i honestly dont think i believed it to begin with its something you see in the movies something you see on tv but its never something that i thought would happen to us especially here in vermont farrell said the companys sales information from the last years was stolen including customers names addresses phone numbers and email addresses however no credit card numbers were part of the breach my message to customers is not to panic dont be worried about your information farrell said just know that its going to take us just a little bit more time to get your sofa to you but were open for business wendells was able to recover most of the data but not all of it they are still missing several months worth of data everything that used to be easy is now really hard farrell said a mcafee report shows that ransomware attacks are up more than percent in the second quarter of over that same time frame in duane dunston teaches cybersecurity at champlain college and says these attacks can be hard to count its not really clear because many organizations may not report it he said it may be easier for them to give them the money and just move on wendells ended up paying thousands of dollars but dunston says that can have repercussions one of the dangers is that they can come back and ask for more money at a later time he explained there really is no way to know whether they are going to delete the data or whatever they are demanding dunston says there is lots of public information on how to protect your data but to make sure you are backing it up and updating your security systems wendells has now reinforced its computer firewalls and replaced parts of its infrastructure that are susceptible to attack were getting back on our feet farrell said customers who financed their purchase with synchrony financial may have had their account numbers compromised but according to wendells that threat is low the business has sent out about letters notifying customers and says they are doing their best to get the word out contact information for the three major credit bureaus equifax po box atlanta ga equifaxcom experian po box allen tx experiancom trans union po box chester pa transunioncom contact information for synchrony bank synchrony bank po box orlando fl mysynchronycom the vermont attorney generals website agovermontgov also has helpful information about fighting identity theftno matter how many layers of security school districts put in place to stop ransomware its inevitable that at some point an endpoint will be infected since january there have been cybersecurityrelated incidents against k schools including ransomware attacks according to the k cybersecurity resource center in percent of k schools hit with ransomware decided to pay attackers in order to get back control of their data according to analysis from the department of education in response the education department has responded with a number of resources to encourage better cybersecurity practices most recently the education department announced it would strip any k school district or higher education institution of title iv funding if it did not adhere to reasonable methods to protect student data but accidents happen and data can be left vulnerable staff should prepare for this possibility by planning and testing recovery strategies well in advance invest in backups to help recover after an attack if unique hardtoreplace data files are stored on an endpoint users should back up those files regularly thats a recommended practice even outside the threat of ransomware creating a backup plan can be complicated especially when dealing with large quantities of data however by investing in proper planning districts can ensure that if ransomware encrypts an endpoints files there will be no need to potentially pay a ransom to recover the files instead schools can simply restore the data from the last backup create avenues for quick endpoint recovery school districts also should be able to quickly rebuild ransomwareinfected endpoints which would wipe out the ransomware and return the endpoint to a clean state as with backups school districts should already have the ability to rapidly rebuild endpoints and ensure theyre properly secured because the same actions are needed for many malwareinfected endpoints when creating a recovery system it is important to have recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives in mind according to unitrends your rto is the most amount of time a district can afford to be without access to its data or systems while rpo refers to the most amount of data a district can afford to lose by setting up recovery solutions built with rpo and rto in mind it teams can ensure the damage sustained from a ransomware attack will be minimal disaster recovery as a service can help ease the burden for k it teams in some districts picking up the pieces after a ransomware attack can be a heavy load and with limited resources may take longer than administrators would like to help districts some companies offer disaster recovery as a service as part of their platforms microsoft for example has draas services incorporated into its azure cloud platform to learn more about data protection read technologies schools must have to stop ransomwaremade famous by the wannacry attack that crippled the nhs in ransomware is continuing to hit businesses according to security research firm symantec infections have steadily increased every year since reaching record levels in even over the last few months ransomware has impacted multiple organizations including the pga of america and the borough of matanuskasusitna in alaska where government workers were forced to use typewriters to carry out their daily tasks it is not surprising that governments are concerned about the impact of the malicious software which locks a users device or data until they pay a ransom in the uk the national cyber security centre ncsc has published advice on mitigating against ransomware meanwhile the uk governments behavioral change campaign for cybersecurity cyber aware promotes simple measures to stay more secure online but according to security researchers there has been a decline in ransomware compared to other threats including cryptomining yet the malicious software remains a very real risk attacks are becoming fewer but more targeted the major difference between and appears to be a trend towards more targeted ransomware says matt shabat strategy director at glasswall solutions instead of seeking mass infections through relatively blunt means threat actors are using more precise infection vectors to achieve initial compromise identifying ransomware ransomware comes in two types the first encrypts the files on a computer or network the second locks a users screen some ransomware will also act like a worm as was the case with wannacry and once inside a network will spread laterally to other machines without interaction by the attacker or the infected user says a ncsc spokesman occasionally malware is presented as ransomware but after the ransom is paid the files are not decrypted this is known as wiper malware the ransom is often demanded in a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin as a prepaid card or gift voucher in many cases the ransom amount is modest a tactic designed to make paying the quickest and cheapest way to resume use the scale and automated nature of a ransomware attack makes it profitable through economies of scale they are attacks of opportunity they are not normally targeted at specific individuals or systems so infections can occur in any sector or organisation the ncsc spokesman says generally if a firm is hit by ransomware they will have no problem realising infected computers will be inaccessible because key files have been encrypted with a ransom note displayed onscreen most ransomware pops up a pay page either in a text editor or on a browser says paul ducklin senior technologist at sophos but a lot of it also changes your desktop wallpaper to a graphical image of the pay page and sadly the first sign of compromise may already be too late especially if ransomware has spread networkwide and every desktop is hijacked says chris boyd malware analyst at malwarebytes much of it comes down to basic social engineering and fake emails aimed at hr with dubious receipt attachments harboring an infection recognizing the warning signs ransomware and email phishing email still remains the top attack vector for all malicious activity says adenike cosgrove cybersecurity strategist emea proofpoint she says the easiest route for cyber criminals is to exploit the vulnerability of humans through simple yet sophisticated social engineering tactics she explains cybercriminals have found new ways to exploit the human factor the instincts of curiosity and trust that lead wellintentioned people to play into the hands of the attacker this could be in the form of a disguised url or seemingly benign attachment but all it takes is one click and the ransomware can take hold immediately the majority of ransomware is spread via massive spam campaigns involving hundreds of thousands of emails sent daily says dick obrien threat researcher at symantec ransomware may also be spread via websites compromised to host whats known as an exploit kit this is a tool that scans the visitors computer to see if its running software with known vulnerabilities says obrien if it finds any it will exploit one of these vulnerabilities to download and install ransomware on the victims computer in a small number of cases firms may be specifically targeted by groups who attempt to break into the companys network and infect as many computers as possible before triggering the ransomware how to fight off ransomware youve been hit so what do you do a lot of ransomware is poorly coded or master keys are leaked and its worth checking online to see if anyone has built a decryptor tool says boyd he says his firm malwarebytes has released standalone versions for certain versions of petya and chimera and theres many more out there whatever you do it is agreed that paying the ransom is a big mistake indeed the national crime agency encourages industry and the public not to pay the ransom we strongly advise not to pay the ransom as it simply encourages the scammers to continue with their profitable business model agrees boyd jake moore cybersecurity specialist at eset says he always advises against paying but i have seen ceos with their heads in their hands asking me what else can we do when they realise their resilience measures have also been attacked yet there is no guarantee that you will ever receive the data back and if you do it might be damaged funding cyber criminals also funds larger cyberattacks so it must be reiterated that paying wont always get make the issue go away says moore and paying is by no means the easy solution according to lital asherdotan vp content and security research cybereason organizations would need to set up a bitcoin wallet to pay the attackers a process that can take a few days how to avoid future ransomware attacks avoiding future attacks requires preparation such as incident response plans and educating employees but boyd says organizations arent training employees in security basics perhaps theyre not sending out emails warning about common scams or maybe they arent bothering with security tools known to prevent exploits and ransomware employees should be trained on how to spot attacks this helps to avoid becoming a victim and also means staff can raise the alarm straight away says rick hemsley managing director accenture security employees can become your strongest line of defense attackers will hit as many people in an organization as possible and one click is all it takes so having a workforce of people ready to sound the alarm will help prevent that one click helen davenport director gowling wlg says its important to look for less obvious attacks looking out for the less obvious attacks is highly advisable if any hint of files being corrupted or encrypted is immediately addressed at the source it will help to reduce the extent of an attack it might seem obvious but backup is integral even without other measures firms would still be able to bring their files back with ease if they had a sensible backup process in place says boyd testing recovery times is a key part of this says moore i always advise companies to do a ransomware drill simulation i have seen firms declare it would take them an hour to get back up online but when tested it has taken three days or more this can create another problem altogether adding to the disaster

it was one of the best performing cryptocurrency during the last bear market while other cryptocurrencies were following bitcoins lead and dropping in price monero was doing relatively well today the news in the headlines is that monero xmr was at the center of a ransomware attack on a comic oatmeal site monero xmr price today xmr usd name price h the criminals demanded in monero xmr as ransom after initiating the attack this is not the first time monero has been demanded in such attacks some critics say that the fact that monero is the most privacy centric cryptocurrency in the industry is what makes it attractive to cyber criminals the attacker planed to blackmail the owner of the ecomic site for personal gains the website founder had to tell the public about it in twitter in his words hello everyone my site is down because of a ddos attack the attacker has sent me an email with his demands they want me to pay a certain amount to stop the attack i am still thinking of what to do but if it continues i may have no choice but the switch hosts thanks for your understanding sources familiar with the matter said that the attacker has requested for in xmr the attack lasted for about three hours before the site owner was able to gain control using an antiddos protocol even if the site owner claimed not to have paid the ransom the news still increased the price of monero xmr significantly monero xmr price analysis now at the time of writing the xmr token was trading at which indicates a rise in price against the usd and a rise in price against bitcoin the trading volume within a hour period is while the market capitalization is about there are currently xmr in supply the next few days of trading will determine if monero will keep trading in green or not mcwpform ida new form of ransomware is spreading to victims around the world and the way its built suggests those behind it could use it to launch more sophisticated attacks in future keypass ransomware first appeared on august and so far has spread to hundreds of victims in more than countries around the world via fake software installers which download the ransomware onto the victims pc brazil and vietnam account for the highest percentage of keypass infections but victims are reported across the world in regions including south america africa europe the middle east and asia researchers at kaspersky lab have examined keypass and found that while its relatively simple it comes with the additional option for the attackers to take manual control of an infected system potentially pointing towards the ability to launch more sophisticated attacks on infected networks see also ransomware an executive guide to one of the biggest menaces on the web the keypass interface contains a module which allows attackers to customise the encryption process by changing parameters including the encryption key the text of the ransom note the extension of the encrypted files and more those who fall victim to keypass are met with a ransom note which details how all your files documents photos databases and other important files are encrypted and have the extension keypass it goes on to add how the only method of recovering files is to buy decrypt software from the attackers for a price which its suggested goes up if contact isnt made within three days of infection the ransom note doesnt contain any indication as to what method of payment is required ransomware distributors usually want cryptocurrency like bitcoin and victims are urged to contact the attackers using an email address registered to switzerland or a backup address in india image kaspersky lab however the identity of the attackers is still unknown as users could register for those addresses from anywhere in the world and the indiscriminate nature of the attacks dont appear to cast light on where the perpetrators could be working from as theres currently no means of decrypting files locked by keypass for free the best means of protecting against it is to not fall victim to it in the first place in this case by being careful about software downloads and ensuring that theyre from an existing source organisations should also ensure that systems are regularly backed up so that if they do fall victim to ransomware they can restore the network from backup without the need to give into the ransom demand the authorities and researchers tell users to never pay cyber criminals for ransomware decryption keys but many ignore this warning as they just want to ensure their systems are back up and running as soon as possible however the very nature of cyber criminals means that even if a ransom is paid some will take the money and run leaving victims with locked systems and out of pocket read more on cyber crimethe professional golfers association of america pga was hit by ransomware just before one of the sports biggest pro events which teed off on thursday scrambled files on its infected computers include creative materials for this weeks pga championship as well as next months ryder cup golf week reported the software nasty struck on tuesday august demanding the association transfer cryptocoins into a given bitcoin wallet to restore the encrypted documents the malwares masterminds reportedly offered to decrypt two files for free as a confidence building measures online speculation suggests the ransomware may be a strain of bitpaymer however this remains unconfirmed bitpaymer recently hit the offices of a number of us municipalities including in the alaskan region of matanuskasusitna whose workers were forced to fall back on typewriters after their computers became unusable a spokesperson for the pga told the register today this is an ongoing situation so we have no comment targeted bitpaymer infects windows pcs and typically spreads by bruteforcing its way into machines via rdp services it was first spotted in july and became widely known after hitting scottish hospitals a month later allan liska senior security architect at threat intel biz recorded future said that based on the ransom note bitpaymer seems the most likely culprit the ransomware is believed to have been developed by the dridex team the same group responsible for the locky ransomware liska added unlike locky which was primarily delivered via phishing attacks bitpaymer is generally delivered as part of an exploitation campaign most often initiated through internetfacing rdp servers he said the dridex team will either exploit unpatched rdp systems or brute force common usernamepassword combinations recovering from bitpaymer attacks is difficult liska added at this time there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by bitpaymer without paying the ransom so files need to be restored from backups he warned the best defense against bitpaymer is to scan your internetfacing systems to ensure there are no publicly accessible rdp servers and to ensure that antivirus and advanced endpoint protection is up to date sponsored following bottomlines journey to the hybrid cloudas the pga championship kicks off at bellerive today the association finds itself with some unpleasant work to do back at the office ransomware has infected several computer systems at the pga of america according to a report published by golf week not typically the kind of place youd expect to see publishing cybersecurity news the ransomware has encrypted a number of files connected to this weekends championship and other upcoming events promotional materials and logos that were created for print and digital advertising have been encrypted and decryption isnt an option not without paying the ransom at least bleeping computer points out similarities between the ransom note left on pga systems and those created by the bitpaymer ransomware bitpaymer has been around for some time but it remains a tough nut to crack there are no freely available decryption tools and the ransom note makes that quite clear the note provided a bitcoin wallet address and a pair of encrypted email addresses the amount of the ransom was not specified but bleeping computer mentions a previous bitpaymer attack demanding bitcoins to restore files thats just over at the current exchange rate in a show of good faith the attackers offered to decrypt two files to prove their decryption system would perform as expected the pga of america reportedly will not take the bait and does not intend to pay decryption is just one way that ransomware victims can recover files restoring those files from a backup is often a faster and safer way to get the job done it also doesnt require interacting with cybercriminals while it staff are still working to restore normal functionality the championship itself has not been impacted in any way the association will not be issuing any comment until the situation has been resolvedlast week shipping giant cosco china ocean shipping company announced it

attacks download httptrafficlibsyncomdigitalundergroundcoscompa new variant of the princess locker ransomware is being distributed called princess evolution like its predecessor princess evolution is a ransomware as a service or raas that is being promoted on underground criminal forums as this ransomware is being distributed through different affiliates there are numerous methods that are possibly being used to distribute this ransomware one method being used to distribute the ransomware is through the rig exploit kit which was discovered by trendmicro unfortunately at this time there is no known way to decrypt files encrypted by princess evolution for those who are interested in discussing this ransomware or receiving support you can use our dedicated princess evolution support help topic princess evolution promoted through underground criminal sites the princess evolution ransomware is a ransomware as a service this means that the developer recruits affiliates to distribute the ransomware and for every payment made the developer earns of the payment and the affiliate gets the remaining these types of arrangements allow the developer to earn revenue by supporting and developing the ransomware program while the affiliates can focus on its distribution to victims the princess evolution ransomware affiliate program is being promoted through underground criminal forums where the developer creates topics about recruiting people to their raas princess evolution recruitment post these posts go on to show the various features that the raas has to offer including the revenue splits the support model its configuration options and more raas features princess evolution being distributed through exploit kits according to a report by trendmicro the princess evolution ransomware has been seen being distributed through the rig exploit kit these exploit kits are installed on hacked sites and exploit vulnerabilities on visitors computers to install the ransomware without their permission or even knowledge network traffic from exploit kit source trendmicro as this is a raas with potentially many affiliates it may also be distributed via other methods used by different distributors how princess evolution encrypts a computer when started princess evolution will create two safety checks that make it so princess locker cant be executed on the same machine more than once the first check is to create a mutex called hojupcvgha and a file at appdatamegezanvde if either of these are detected the ransomware will not run this was discovered by security researcher valthek after he analyzed the ransomware princessevolution raas sisoma drtrm bleepincomputer malwrhunterteam mcafeelabs this ransomware have checks in the start to avoid reinfect the machinea mutex with the name hojupcvgha without quotes and one file in appdata with name megezanvde no quotes valthek valthekon august if princess evolution is able to run it will communicate with the command control server over udp as shown below according to trendmicro it will transmit the username of the infected computer name of network interface the os version victim encryption key and more princess evolution network traffic via udp after sending information it will begin to scan drives for files to encrypt for each victim it will create a unique random extension that it uses when encrypting files on the computer for example when i tested the ransomware the random extension that was used is kfsaj and was appended to all the files that were encrypted princess evolution encrypted folder as it encrypts files it will also create three ransom notes in each folder called hwtorecverextensionurl hwtorecverextensiontxt and hwtorecverextensionhtml the text and html ransom notes contain links to the tor payment site and the victims unique id the url file will open up the tor payment site princess evolution ransom note as previously stated princess evolution cannot be decrypted for free at this time if you need more info about this ransomware or wish to discuss it with your peers you can use our dedicated princess evolution support help topic princess evolution tor payment site the princess evolution tor payment site is used by victims to get information on how to pay the ransomware the ransom amount the ability to decrypt one file free and various instructions for my test install the ransomware amount was bitcoins or approximately usd this tor payment site is one of the nicer ones we have seen in a long time the opening page contains an animated image as shown below tor front page image once you click on the page you will be presented with a login form where a victim can enter their unique victim id from their ransom notes once a user logs in they will be presented with a payment site that contains numerous pages including a free decryption page decrypt one file for free other pages include a help page instructions on how to purchase bitcoins and information on what happened to the victims files how to protect yourself from princess evolution in order to protect yourself from ransomware the most important step is to always have a reliable and tested backup of your data that can be restored in the case of an emergency such as a ransomware attack also as this particular ransomware is being distributed via exploit kits make sure you update all of your installed programs including windows to the latest security updates you should also make sure that you do not have any computers running remote desktop services connected directly to the internet instead place computers running remote desktop behind vpns so that they are only accessible to those who have vpn accounts on your network a good security software solution that incorporates behavioral detections to combat ransomware and not just use signature detections or heuristics is important as well for example emsisoft antimalware and malwarebytes antimalware both contain behavioral detection that can prevent many if not most ransomware infections from encrypting a computer last but not least make sure you practice the following security habits which in many cases are the most important steps of all backup backup backup do not download cracks as they are major source of infections do not open attachments if you do not know who sent them do not open attachments until you confirm that the person actually sent you them scan attachments with tools like virustotal do not connect remote desktop services directly to the internet instead make sure they can only be accessed by logging into a vpn first make sure all windows updates are installed as soon as they come out also make sure you update all programs especially java flash and adobe reader older programs contain security vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by malware distributors therefore it is important to keep them updated make sure you use have some sort of security software installed that uses behavioral detections or white list technology white listing can be a pain to train but if your willing to stock with it could have the biggest payoffs use hard passwords and never reuse the same password at multiple sites backup for a complete guide on ransomware protection you visit our how to protect and harden a computer against ransomware article iocs hashes

police department servers have hamstrung law enforcement in ways previously unknown to the public including the possibility riverside could permanently lose access to one of the states police computer networks if attacked again a dayton daily news investigation found the ransomware cyberattacks in april and may which have cost the city tens of thousands of dollars shut down the police departments records management system used to create and store investigative reports the attacks forced riverside police officers to use a backup system on the ohio law enforcement gateway a statewide computer database operated by the ohio attorney generals bureau of criminal investigation for local police departments but four days after the dayton daily news revealed the may cyberattack hit the city the ags office revoked the citys access to the gateway to shield the network from damage and protect confidential information from exposure a spokeswoman said the dayton daily news investigation found police not only lost the ability to access and print past reports as acknowledged by police chief frank robinson in public statements but at one point lost the ability to make digital reports altogether losing the gateway forced officers to hand write reports and type incident narratives into microsoft word so that they could be scanned into the system once restored an internal memo said by the time robinson made his statement in july the ability to make digital reports was resolved by getting the usual records system back up and running he said but the ags office had not then and still has not now fully restored access to the gateway network meaning the department cant fully use other gateway functions unmentioned by robinson to the public the gateway is our backup reporting system the system we use to create photo lineups for investigations how we enter evidence that needs to be processed at the bci lab and the quickest way to obtain criminal history on suspects major matt sturgeon wrote in a may email to the fire chief and assistant city manager this is really hampering our effectiveness this is vital sturgeon wrote nearly a month later in a memo to the chief this week after the dayton daily news brought its findings to the department sturgeon told the chief that the gateways loss has impacted operations but we have found the means to make due by other paths officers now use another computer program to create photo lineups according to the memo instead of directly accessing criminal history on the gateway officers now radio dispatch and wait to obtain the information and instead of using the gateway to make state crime lab requests and receive finished lab reports the department had to make handwritten lab requests until last month officers had to pick up the completed reports at the state crime lab in madison county the loss in no way leaves our citizens vulnerable when they call for police services sturgeon wrote in the memo robinson reiterated this in an interview tuesday i think the main thing we want to make sure people understand is that we are doing exactly what we should be doing every day to make sure the public is as safe as possible theres no slack in how were responding or prioritizing our calls or anything like that the dayton daily news used ohios public records laws to obtain more than pages of internal city emails and memos the newspapers examination and subsequent interviews also found in order to protect the gateway the ags office has a threestrike policy for agencies that fall victim to cyberattacks the ag does not have a remediation to restore gateway access after a third strike the attacks in april and may count as strikes no and no meaning if riverside is hit again the department will be permanently blocked from the gateway unless the ags office is satisfied the issues are remedied agencies that use the gateway are required to notify the ags office of security breaches but an ag spokeswoman said the state was not contacted about either ransomware attack city manager mark carpenter this week said he was surprised by the spokeswomans statement because city staff had internal discussions about the need to alert the state assistant city manager chris lohr later acknowledged riverside may have overlooked notifying the ag the ags office learned about the attacks through news reports and suspended riversides gateway access on may four days after the dayton daily news revealed the second attack to the public and days after riversides computer network was compromised for the second time matthew curtin a columbusbased cybersecurity expert applauded the ags office for yanking access calling it a pretty good example of how a provider of sensitive information governs access to its information presently one riverside records clerk is authorized to access past reports on the gateway from computers in huber heights the same day the dayton daily news reported the police department lost gateway access the city manager emailed the police chief to move quickly to establish gateway access in huber heights the limited access was granted on july a day later riversides data at rest essentially information stored on but not in transit over the police departments network uses very basic controls with no encryption according to an email from riversides it contractor encryption uses a cipher or code to protect data and prohibit unauthorized parties from being able to read it lohr the assistant city manager said the city is considering encrypting the data in coming months he said paramedics transfer hipaaprotected information over an encrypted connection to a webbased cloud program not hosted by the city curtin who founded interhack corp called it a bad practice for any police department not to encrypt sensitive data if you have sensitive information and you dont protect it with anything more than a password you are doing nothing to protect it from a number of attacks including just stealing the thing said curtin a former ohio state university computer science senior lecturer the fact that you have the password is irrelevant city officials estimate gateway access could be fully restored in the next to days once riverside meets the stringent security guidelines dictated by the ags office we have to take action and we want to make sure we do it right carpenter said this week were looking to invest in some new equipment and building a more secure network carpenter said in order to make the network secure initial investment will be in the neighborhood of ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts or locks digital files and demands a ransom to release them according to the fbi atlanta is among the largest municipal victims everyday users of computers can fall victim to malware too readers should understand that cybersecurity is not an it problem curtin said the vast majority of the kind of problems were seeing right now come down to users being fooled into the wrong thing including clicking on the wrong thing going to websites that dont make sense for them to go on and generally doing things that are stupid the dayton daily news dayton ohio distributed by tribune content agency llca borough and a town in alaska have been hit by a devastating ransomware attack forcing employees to completely forego computers and go back to typewriters and hand receipts matanuskasusitna matsu a borough in the anchorage metropolitan statistical area has declared disaster on tuesday after being hit by several different strains of malware that crippled its computer infrastructure including computers servers telephones and email exchange the city of valdez alaska has also been hit by the malware attack the cyberattack has caused major disruption in borough services and loss of productivity which may continue for a prolonged time assembly member ted leonard said at a matsu assembly meeting tuesday according to a report by matsu boroughs it director eric wyatt the attack was multipronged multivectored its components including the emotet trojan horse bitpaymer ransomware and an actual hacker logging into the boroughs network some of the malware was dormant on the boroughs computers since as early as may the report said but the attack culminated on july when the crypto locker portion of the malware started encrypting the drives of computers on the network all in all nearly all of the boroughs workstations and out of servers were affected according to the report this was a zeroday attack meaning that it used exploits that were never seen before to give you an idea of the damage this type of attack can do on a citys infrastructure here are some of the services that were affected pool libraries animal care landfill collections as well as a number of web services such as ecommerce the matsu government said monday that most data was not lost to the cyber attack without computers and files borough employees acted resourcefully they reenlisted typewriters from closets and wrote by hand receipts and lists of library book patrons and landfill fees at some of the different buildings public affairs director at matsu patty sullivan wrote in a post last week the bitpaymer ransomware made headlines in august when it hit several scottish hospitals causing delays and cancellations in procedures and appointments upon infection it encrypts many of the files it finds asking a cryptocurrency payment in order to unlock them both the matsu borough and the city of valdez are cooperating with the fbi in restoring their services and investigating the attack officials saidwasaga beachs information technology department would not have been able to fend off this springs ransomware attack of the municipalitys computer network on its own thats the conclusion of jason green of hexigent consulting in a ransomware incident report presented to council members at their aug coordinated committee meeting the expectation of the towns it department is to provide broad technology support under a limited budget he wrote the knowledge methods and techniques required to combat an attack of this complexity is typically found in dedicated cyber specialists with many years of digital combat experience on april the municipalitys servers were taken over by hackers through a ransomware attack the hackers initially demanded bitcoins approximately to release the decryption key to unlock the towns servers the town eventually paid three bitcoins worth approximately however other costs including the loss of productivity new hardware and consultant costs is estimated to top for an incident that hampered the towns network for several weeks treasurer jocelyn lee who also oversees the it department expects there will be an additional to in costs those costs have been built into the budget some costs are ongoing and some will be periodic onetime costs she told simcoecom however details such as how the attack occurred and recommendations related to preventing future attacks were redacted from the public report those details have been presented to council behind closed doors lee told simcoecom the information was redacted from the public document for security reasonsrecovery from the ransomware attack on coweta countys computer systems included shutting off server access for various systems including the coweta county sheriffs office dispatch and coweta as well as the coweta tag office library checkout systems and others server access was restricted for part of the day friday said patricia palmer cowetas director of human and community relations be in the know the moment news happens subscribe to daily and breaking news alerts sometimes when they do things they have to take things down and bring it back up palmer said access was restored for the ccso and tag office by friday afternoon she said the restoration process is methodical as server access is returned on a priority basis palmer said early on sunday aug county it staff discovered a ransomware attack running through the countys servers the issue was first noticed by public safety officials who were having problems with the public safety computer systems all the countys servers were shut down to stop the spread of the ransomware known as bitpaymer the ransomware worms its way through the countys servers locking down data with encryption a way to unlock the encryption was offered for a ransom the county decided to not pay the ransom and instead to restore all systems from backups which were done just a few days before the attack some county employees were able to receive and send emails thursday while other email addresses were still not functional on friday palmer said she hopes that everything will be back to normal by early this week in the meantime phone calls are the best way to reach county offices and employeesintroduction the first step in recovering from ransomware is probably along the lines of dont get attacked by ransomware but as time goes by that seems to become less of a possibility the ransomware threat isnt going away and is actually evolving frankly the best strategy for recovery might be to prepare for the worst according to the verizon data breach investigations report ransomware is the most prevalent form of malware attack up from its spot at no in and no just last year this rapid ascent up the ranks shouldnt come as a surprise to anyone keeping up with data protection news but that doesnt make it any less alarming ransomware can be a costly disaster to recover from even if you dont pay the ransom in fact the first rule of ransomware recovery should actually be dont pay the ransom theres no honor among data thieves and payment does not guarantee the release of your data so what is there to do plan ahead for starters as ransomware evolves a simple backup plan wont cut it anymore and you have to keep recovery in mind early on whether your data storage of choice is cloud tape disk or flash you need to have a recovery plan catered to ransomware in particular unlike natural disasters ransomware attacks can strike any organization in any region and the results can be disastrous your priorities when recovering from ransomware will likely differ based on your organizations needs in many cases its not just a matter of getting your data back but complying with data protection regulations or agreements whether your priority is business continuity bc compliance or simply getting your data back as quickly and cheaply as possible this guide should help you gauge the threat ransomware poses for you and understand how prepared you are dont forget to stick around until the end where you can test what youve learned with our ransomware recovery quizglutton ransomware the newest version of scarab ransomware that is spreading from russia to the remaining world glutton ransomware is a cryptovirus that has the main purpose of money extortion it offers testing its decryption service by sending three locked files to virus developers glutton ransomware is a cryptovirus that was first detected in june the first attacks were spotted in russia however at the moment this version of scarab ransomware is actively spreading all over the world this virus infects the system with the help of phishing emails and immediately scans it for users mostly used files ransomware uses the aes encryption method to lock this data and appends glutton file extension this is why the infection is alternatively called as scarabglutton ransomware after this file modification the virus drops a text file named as how to recover encrypted filestxt this is the direct message for the victim containing more details about the attack and instructions for further actions in this note a victim will find out that the ransom amount depends on the time he or she spent before contacting the cybercriminals via gluttonbdprotonmailcom email address however it is not advisable to contact these hackers or paying the ransom it may lead to permanent data or even money loss name glutton scarabglutton type ransomware family scarab extension glutton ransom note how to recover encrypted filestxt contact email gluttonbdprotonmailcom distribution spam email attachments elimination use reimage for the ransomware removal glutton files virus is hailing from a dangerous crypto family which is known as scarab this family has been actively spreading around for almost a half year and has successfully attacked home users and businesses this variant of scarab ransomware seems to have russia as its primary target however the ransom note can be translated into several languages so there is no doubt that the malware is ready to attack other countries as well glutton ransomware virus works as other versions of crypto infections it locks your files using sophisticated encryption methods and appends glutton file extension to the modified data to make it unavailable for the use this virus may affect anything from photos videos or documents to even archived files after this encryption process ransomware places a ransom note how to recover encrypted filestxt that provides numerous details about the attack and also gives the victim an email address to contact virus developers the file content may differ from victim to victim but the main information remains the same after being informed about the encryption of specific files the unaware user is asked to pay from to btc or another cryptocurrency the ransom message of scarabglutton reads your files are now encrypted your personal identifier all your files have been encrypted due to a security problem with your pc now you should send us email with your personal identifier this email will be as confirmation you are ready to pay for decryption key you have to pay for decryption in bitcoins the price depends on how fast you write to us after payment we will send you the decryption tool that will decrypt all your files contact us using this email address gluttonbdprotonmailcom free decryption as guarantee before paying you can send us up to files for free decryption the total size of files must be less than mb non archived and files should not contain valuable information databases backups large excel sheets etc attention do not rename encrypted files do not try to decrypt your data using third party software it may cause permanent data loss decryption of your files with the help of third parties may cause increased price they add their fee to our or you can become a victim of a scam scarabs developers have also been offering their victims to test their decryption service by sending them three files they also state that their decryption tool is the only way to recover these files unfortunately there is a possibility that this alleged decryption tool doesnt exist besides the people behind this ransomware can also stop communicating with their victims right after receiving the money for the glutton decrypter to sum up contacting people is not an option many reaserchers have stated that ransomware developers tend to disappear after the payment is done if you got infected you need to remove glutton ransomware at first otherwise the virus will take over your files again right after you reboot your computer additionally try data recovery methods that we provided below of course the easiest way to get your files back is restoring them from backup however if you dont have extra copies use tips that we provided in this article

particularly wary retailers are increasingly targeted by ransomware which has the effect of stopping retail operations and revenue generation in its tracks sonicwall malware expert brook chelmo writes in a blog post whats more the longterm impact on customer perception and brand reputation can devastate a business long after the attack ends a carbon black survey found that percent of consumers said they would consider leaving a retailer if it were hit with ransomware though that report focused on the wannacry outbreak that targeted more than global victims hackers have developed several types of ransomware popular variants include traditional lock screen ransomware master boot record infections and pure encryption any attack against vulnerable pointofsale pos technology represents a nightmare scenario for retailers locked out of the system store associates would be completely unable to run transactions why retailers shouldnt pay the ransom the threat of lost sales may be why so many retailers give in to hackers demands according to a survey from security technology company radware about percent of retailers and wholesalers have paid the ransom after a cyberextortion attack but security experts advise against putting up the money which averages million per ransomware incident radware found thats because each successful payoff encourages further attacks and still doesnt guarantee file or system recovery according to the cyberedge groups cyberthreat defense report only percent of hacking victims who pay the ransom actually get their data back defending against ransomware in light of the low recovery rate for ransomed files the best course of action for retailers is to prevent hackers from taking their businesses hostage in the first place defending against attacks requires a multilayered security strategy that incorporates people processes and technology used in conjunction with tools such as antivirus software and email filters these five components can help retailers protect or recover their data network segmentation isolating pos systems from the rest of the network through network segmentation makes retailers less susceptible to attack the technology relies on firewalls and virtual lans to prevent unauthorized traffic from traveling between points on the network sadik alabdulla director of security solutions with cdw calls segmentation a fundamental necessity to network security encryption retailers surveyed in the thales data threat report identify encryption as the most effective toolset for protecting data at rest in motion or in use the report found that percent of retailers plan to implement database and file encryption in the coming year motivated in part by the european unions new stricter general data protection regulation gdpr and the technologys ability to strengthen access control in both traditional data centers and the cloud user training staff awareness of common ransomware pitfalls can make or break a businesss security strategy ransomware often gains access to systems when users click on links or attachments infected with malware that means associates in both the front and back of the store need to stay on high alert for suspicious content thirdparty support outsourcing security responsibilities to a trusted services provider gives retailers access to the latest and greatest data protection technologies the national institute of standards and technologys smallbusiness information security guide recommends partnering with a provider that holds recognized professional certifications and has experience working with similar clients other retailers in this case data backups though performing frequent backups isnt actually a prevention technique it is a vital strategy for recovering from a ransomware attack the us computer emergency readiness team recommends storing backups offline on a separate device and verifying backups regularly if ransomware affects your system you can restore your system to its previous state with any files unaffected by ransomware cert notes download cdws cybersecurity insight report to learn more about how organizations are managing risk in more effective waysthe highly sophisticated operation shares code with the hermes malware and may be linked to the lazarus group apt actor a targeted new ransomware has burst on the scene attacking wellchosen targeted organizations worldwide with a highly sophisticated operation that may be linked to a wellknown apt actor over the past two weeks the ryuk ransomware has encrypted hundreds of pcs storage and data centers in each of the companies that its infected according to check point including within three highvalue enterprises in the us so far the ongoing campaign has netted for the threat actors unlike the common ransomware systematically distributed via massive spam campaigns and exploit kits ryuk is used exclusively for tailored attacks check point researchers said in a post on the code today in fact its encryption scheme is intentionally built for smallscale operations such that only crucial assets and resources are infected in each targeted network with its infection and distribution carried out manually by the attackers researchers said that the attackers are asking for varied sums in return for file decryption depending on the target ranging from btc to btc roughly to some organizations paid an exceptionally large ransom they noted the attackers are tailoring their communications approach to the victims too including using two different ransom notes one is longer wellworded and nicely phrased according to check point and used for organizations slapped with higher ransom requests a second note is for the less lucrative victims featuring a blunter note overall the operation is clearly a sophisticated one involving plenty of recon activities like extensive network mapping hacking and credential collection this suggests a wellhoned actor pulling the strings and check point found suggestions in its analysis of the activities that north koreas lazarus group apt could possibly be behind it all however attribution is somewhat difficult especially given that while tracking the money trail researchers saw that ryuks authors are disguising their received payments by dividing and transferring them among multiple wallets after a ransom payment is made to a preassigned wallet some percent of the funds are transferred to a new wallet the remaining amount is also transferred to a new wallet however the remaining funds are split and relocated again ryuk ransomware has not been widely distributed it has only been used in targeted attacks which makes it a lot harder to track the malware authors activities and revenues check point analysts said almost each malware sample was provided a unique wallet and shortly after the ransom payment was made the funds were divided and transmitted through multiple other accounts connections to hermes while the operation is sophisticated the ransomwares technical capabilities are relatively low check point found however its code has notable similarities to the hermes ransomware a malware commonly attributed to the lazarus group hermes first gained publicity in october when it was used as part of a sophisticated swift attack against the far eastern international bank feib in taiwan code similarities include the fact that ryuks encryption logic resembles that found in the hermes ransomware the researchers said indeed if we compare the function that encrypts a single file we see much similarity in its structure according to check point in fact it seems that the author of ryuk did not even bother to change the marker in the encrypted files as the code used to generate place and verify this marker in order to determine if a file was already encrypted are identical in both malwares also the firm noted that both whitelist similar folders eg ahnlab microsoft chrome mozilla recyclebin etc both write a batch script named windowbat in the same path and in both cases there are files dropped to disk public and uniqueiddonotremove that are similar in name and purpose this leads us to believe that the current wave of targeted attacks using ryuk may either be the work of the hermes operators the allegedly north korean group or the work of an actor who has obtained the hermes source code researchers noted also as regards the whitelisted files the ransomware performs a standard recursive sweep of every drive and network share on the victim system and encrypts every file and directory except for those containing text from the hardcoded whitelist its clear why the attackers would want the victims web browser intact given that it may be required for reading the ransom note purchasing cryptocurrency and so on researchers noted but it is less clear why the attackers are concerned with encrypting the victims copy of a south korean endpoint protection product especially given that this attack wasnt even targeted at south korean users it does make sense however if the hermes ransomware is being reused and rebranded as ryuk ransomware further when it comes to the trust model the original hermes actually generated the tiertwo pervictim rsa keypairs as opposed to embedding hardcoded copies in the malware samples however the encryption function itself including the encrypted file format and its associated unique hermes file magic are reproduced wholesale in the rebranded version ultimately both the nature of the attack and the malwares own inner workings tie ryuk to the hermes ransomware this arouses curiosity regarding the identity of the group behind it and its connection to the lazarus group researchers concluded we believe that this is not the end of this campaign and that additional organizations are likely to fall victim to ryuksamsam has taken in nearly million in ransom and its victims have been diverse they havent all been healthcare and government agencies as has been reported in a lot of the media the majority of the victims were actually regular privatesector businesses the takeaway everyone needs to be careful because these guys are indiscriminate download this whitepaper to learn more aboutby fred donovan august samsam ransomware attacks which have targeted healthcare organizations has netted its creator million so far according to a recent report by security firm sophos threequarters of the victims are based in the united states and the largest ransom paid by an individual victim is medium to large organizations in healthcare education and government make up half of the identified victims healthcare victims include indianabased hancock health hospital and adams memorial hospital cloudbased ehr provider allscripts and possibly case regional medical center based on sophos research of the bitcoin addresses in ransom notes it estimated that about victims have paid a ransom to the attacker the report noted that samsam attackers wait for an opportune moment typically launching the encryption commands in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning of the victims local time zone when most users and admins would be asleep samsam encrypts not only document files images and other personal or work data but also configuration and data files required to run applications victims whose backup strategy only protects the users documents and files wont be able to recover a machine without reimaging it sophos explained the cost victims are charged in ransom has increased significantly and the tempo of attacks shows no sign of slowing down according to the report sophos identified six stages of a samsam ransomware attack target identification and acquisition penetrating the network elevating privileges scanning the network for target computers deploying and executing the ransomware and awaiting payment the attacker gives the victim roughly seven days to pay the ransom although for an additional cost this time can be extended the report observed security firm mcafee found that attackers increased their samsam ransomware attacks against the healthcare sector in the first quarter of with numerous cases of hospitals paying the ransom to regain access to their systems according to mcafee healthcare saw a percent jump in cyberattacks in the first quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of healthcare was the most targeted sector in terms of the number of breaches in the period followed by the public sector and education earlier this year hhs warned about samsam ransomware zeroing in on healthcare organizations and government agencies samsams signature is the encryption of files and data with the weapologize extension the display of a sorry message and the use of a sorryforfileshtml ransom note the hhs related hhs explained that samsam hackers focus their attacks on open remote desktop protocol rdp connections and break into networks by carrying out bruteforce attacks against these endpoints because samsam hackers attack rdp connections hhs recommended that healthcare organizations restrict access behind firewalls with rdp gateways and virtual private networks use strongunique username and passwords with twofactor authentication limit users who can log in using remote desktop and implement an account lockout policy to help thwart brute force attacks hhs said that organization should consider the following factors before they pay the ransom paying a ransom does not guarantee an organization will regain access to their data some individuals or organizations were never provided with decryption keys after paying a ransom some victims who paid the ransom were targeted again by cyber actors after paying the originally ransom some victims were asked to pay more to get the promised decryption key paying could encourage this criminal business model ransomware attacks have had material impacts on healthcare services to patients both through attacks on patient care facilities themselves and through attacks on supporting organizations because of the healthcare sectors reliance on it systems and the operational importance of patient data and records the ransomware risk is expected to increase hhs said it encourages organizations to use data backups and develop contingency and business continuity plans that can ensure resilient operations in the event of a ransomware eventthe hackers behind the notorious samsam ransomware variant have made more than million from their victims since and with new major victims during the last few weeks theres no end in sight healthcare organizations need to fill those major vulnerabilities now with an estimated new victim each day a recent report from cybersecurity firm sophos found that about one out of four victims paid at least some of the ransom to make matters worse hackers have steadily increased the ransom demand since the attack began to spike in january researchers analyzed data from the attacks spoke to victims mined private and public samsam samples to compile the information and worked with cryptocurrency monitoring and blockchain firm neutrino to track down the transactions the results were damning for the us and for the healthcare industry about percent of samsams victims were in the us and percent of those happened in the healthcare industry in fact the other sectors government and education had fewer victims combined many victims didnt specifically name samsam instead the researchers were able to identify samsam by collaborating with other security teams that being said percent of healthcare sector victims went public with the true cause cause for concern of the victims actually paid the ransom and the fbi and security leaders all specifically warn against paying for numerous reasons including the fact that funds support the crimes and theres no guarantee of getting the data back racking up victims samsam is not a new virus but attacks have exponentially increased throughout the first major publicized healthcare victim was allscripts hackers breached the ehr companys data centers on jan and the platform did not return to normal operations for more than a week but that was only the start samsam took down the atlanta government for several days and within a few weeks of allscripts two indianabased providers fell victim hancock health and adams memorial hancock health admitted to paying the ransom to regain its data these attacks got the attention of the government and the department of health and human services hhs released an alert in april warning the sector that the hackers had already claimed organizations in three short months shortly after the alert indianas allied physicians of michiana fell victim to samsam on may and july reportedly claimed two more healthcare victims cass regional medical center and medical testing giant labcorp both faced network interruptions lasting about a week time to act by looking at samsams victims across all sectors theres one major standout all organizations are potential victims no matter the size or businesstype the question is how can a provider prevent falling victim the good news is that samsam is relatively straightforward and uses a few different methods to get into a system but hospitals that fail to monitor an abnormal number of login attempts are incredibly vulnerable as are those that use weak or reused passwords or fail to limit admin credentials samsam is spread through the web java apps and other webbased apps and once its in the system it spreads without malicious emails while the virus can be stopped if detected before it gets into the system its over once it has breached the network hackers scan the internet to find open remote desktop protocol connections or jboss servers and use either brute force attacks or access or password vulnerabilities on these endpoints researchers dont believe hackers are looking to access data rather the virus is meant to spread to other computers and devices throughout the network to demand a ransom payment hhs recommends restricting access behind firewalls and using twofactor authentication organizations need to limit who has access to rdps and use an account lockout policy the key method for stopping brute force attacks with rdp backdoors being sold for just on the dark web and thousands of these ports added to the marketplace daily these attacks wont stop until healthcare locks down all its endpoints twitter jfdavis email the writer jessicadavishimssmediacomthe samsam ransomware has reportedly collected over usmil rmmil in payout so far says security software firm sophos first reported in late the ransomware is known for targeting medium to large public sector organisations in healthcare education and government however the recent study states that this only makes up of the total number of identified victims and the rest it claims comprises a private sector that has remained uncharacteristically quiet about the attacks the research samsam the almost six million dollar ransomware states that of the known victims are based in the united states while other regions known to have suffered attacks include canada britain and the middle east while there are no malaysiaspecific statistics in the study reported cases closest to our region occurred in india and australia the largest amount of ransom paid by a victim stands at us rm says the report although it doesnt identify from who or whereunlike other ransomwares where the spam campaign is sent to a large number of random people those operating samsam target their victims specifically the team though the study also claims that it is possible for samsam to be the work of one individual break into a victims network and monitor it closely before making a move how the attacker identifies the organisations is unknown says the report they could be purchasing lists of vulnerable servers from other hackers on the dark web or simply using publicly available search engines such as shodan or censys it states samsam attacks usually happen in the middle of the night or the early hours of the morning of the victims local time zone when most users and admins would probably be unaware of the intrusion the attackers often use software like nlbrute to correctly guess weak passwords and force their way into the victims network via remote desktop protocol rdp a quick search on shodan will generate thousands of ip addresses accessible over port the default rdp port states the report unlike wannacry or notpetya ransomwares samsam doesnt spread by itself instead it has to be manually distributed by the human attacker who by the time of the attack understand the environment and defences thanks to the initial surveillance once in the attackers will keep trying to increase their privileges to the domain admin level while they scan the network for valuable targets and deploy and execute the malware as a sysadmin using utilities such as psexec or paexec the ransomware not only encrypts document files images and other personal or work data but also configuration and data files required to run applications like microsoft office once the attack has been launched the attacker waits to see if the victim contacts the attacker using the details provided in the ransom note the study shows that the victim roughly get seven days to pay the ransom although for an additional cost this time can be extended working with cryptocurrency monitoring organisation neutrino the report shares that the ransom was demanded and paid in bitcoins and a total of unique bitcoin addresses have received ransom payments as well as addresses which have been used on ransom notes and sample files but to date have not received payments to avoid becoming a victim sophos advises that the best defence against samsam or any other form of malware is to adopt a layered defence in depth approach to security staying on top of patching and also maintaining good password discipline will provide a formidable barrier to samsam attacks this barrier can then be strengthened significantly with steps like restricting rdp access to staff connecting over a virtual private network vpn using multifactor authentication for vpn access and sensitive internal systems complete regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests and keeping backups offline and offsitereports from multiple news sources as well as from cosco itself are showing that the major shipping company has succumbed to a ransomware attack in a company statement released on facebook due to the website still being down at the time of this articles writing cosco china ocean shipping co had this to say due to the local network breakdown within our americas region local email and network telephone is not working properly at the moment for safety precautions we have shut down connections with other regions for further investigations so far all vessels of our company are operating normally and our main business operation systems are stable we are glad to inform you that we have taken effective measures and aside from the americas region the business operation within all other regions will be recovered very soon the business operations in the americas are still being carried out and we are trying our best to make a full and quick recovery we will keep you updated of the latest progress through various channels there is more to the story though as the maritime news site lloyds list reports this was not a network breakdown but ransomware attack their sources for this information are internal emails from cosco in which a ransomware attack is directly mentioned contents of the emails in question contained direct instructions such as telling employees not to open suspicious emails additionally the company stated internally that they have requested a computer inspection in china with antimalware software the investigation is ongoing but as with all ransomware it was likely caused by someone unknowingly executing files in an attachment or by clicking on a link that was malicious the social engineering aspect of ransomware is what keeps the attack on the common list of hacking methods for cybercriminals somebody is always willing to take the bait in your phishing emails and when they do you can capitalize it is not known at the time of writing this article what kind of ransomware cosco came under attack from should the company further release information that pertains to this there may be a followup post on this issue featured image cosco read nextthis was a pretty quiet week with mostly small variants one new active release and a large organization getting hit the first big story this week is the pga of americas computers getting hit with what appears to be the bitpaymer ransomware this ransomware accesses networks by brute forcing the passwords

ransomware that appends the poolezoor extension to encrypted files thats it for this week hope everyone has a nice weekendsamples of the malware have been found in an array of countries including brazil and vietnam a new variant of the keypass ransomware has been gaining traction in august and is using new techniques like manual control to customize its encryption process researchers said monday researchers at kaspersky lab who posted about the trojan said that it is being propagated by means of fake installers that download the ransomware module according to our statistics the criminals have begun spreading the ransomware only a few days ago orkhan mamedov malware analyst at kaspersky lab told threatpost today the information contained in the executable pe header confirms the assumption that the trojan was created recently the trojan sample discovered was written in c and compiled in ms visual studio researchers said while they wouldnt go into any further details about possible targets research shows that samples of the malware have been mainly found in brazil and vietnam once on the victims computer after being distributed via fake installers the trojan copies its executable to the local app data folder localappdata and launches it it then deletes itself from the original location following that the trojan generates several copies of its own process to pass along the encryption key and victim id as command line arguments keypass enumerates local drives and network shares accessible from the infected machine and searches for all files regardless of their extension researchers said it skips files located in a number of directories the paths to which are hardcoded into the sample each of these encrypted files gets an additional extension keypass as well as ransom notes named keypassdecryptioninfotxt that are saved in each processed directory a lot of ransomware write the amount of ransom right in the ransom note left on the infected machine said mamedov the keypass trojan is not an exception the text of the note is stored inside the malware and the amount of is specified there if the cc is inaccessible or if the infected machine is not connected to the internet or the server is down the trojan can use a hardcoded key and id that means that in the case of offline encryption it wont be difficult to decrypt the victims files researchers said manual control the trojan contains a form that is hidden by default but also contains manual control meaning its form can be shown after pressing a special button on the keyboard this capability might be an indication that the criminals behind the trojan intend to use it in manual attacks while this feature does not mean much for the victim it is just a characteristic that researchers found notable to describe as it is uncommon among other ransomware families mamedov told threatpost this form allows the attacker to customize the encryption process by changing such parameters as encryption key name of ransom note text of ransom note victim id extension of the encrypted files and list of paths to be excluded from the encryption due to the ability of manual encryption the criminal can easily change the price of the decryption mamedov said the malware operates automatically by default he said however if the criminal was somehow able to gain the remote control to the infected system the trojan allows the criminal to modify the default encryption parameters users can protect themselves from the keypass ransomware by always having backups installing software only from the trusted sources using only strong passwords for rdp access and using a reliable security solutionorganizations from cosco to fedex local governments from atlanta to alaska and several hospitals and law firms around the world all share a common jarring experience in the past year all of these organizations have watched as malicious software took over their networks and demanded a ransom payment while disrupting their business service continuity ransomware is an escalating increasingly sophisticated threat and no one seems to be immune with new ransomware authors constantly upping their game to evade detection by demanding new forms of cryptocurrency such as dash or stealing passwords and bitcoin wallets it can be difficult for the average user to understand how they were infected in the first place when they fall victim to an attack there are a number of attack vectors ransomware can exploit to take over computers or servers these are the four most common ways ransomware infects its victims phishing emails the most common method for hackers to spread ransomware is through phishing emails hackers use carefully crafted phishing emails to trick a victim into opening an attachment or clicking on a link that contains a malicious file that file can come in a number of different formats including a pdf zip file word document or javascript in the case of a word document the attacker most commonly tricks the user into enabling macros upon opening the document this enables the attacker to run a script that downloads and executes a malicious executable file exe from an external web server the exe would include the functions necessary to encrypt the data on the victims machine once the data is encrypted and ransomware gains a foothold on one machine the more advanced ransomware variants will spread to other machines on the network pcs and servers all it takes is for one person to naively open an attachment in the phishing email and an entire organization can be infected popular ransomware exploiting victims using phishing emails include remote desktop protocol an increasingly popular mechanism in which attackers are infecting victims is through remote desktop protocol rdp as the name implies remote desktop protocol was created to enable it administrators to securely access a users machine remotely to configure it or to simply use the machine rdp typically runs over port while opening doors to a device for legitimate use has many benefits it also presents an opportunity for a bad actor to exploit it for illegitimate use in it was determined that over million machines are advertising themselves to the public internet as having port open ie they are running rdp over hackers can simply search for those machines on search engines such as shodanio to find devices that are vulnerable to infection once the target machines are identified hackers commonly gain access by bruteforcing the password so they can log on as an administrator open source passwordcracking tools help achieve this objective popular tools including cain and able john the ripper and medusa allow cybercriminals to quickly and automatically try multiple passwords to gain access once theyre in as an administrator hackers have full control of the machine and can initiate the ransomware encryption operation to create additional damage some hackers will disable the endpoint security software running on the machine or delete windows file backups prior to running the ransomware this creates even more reason for the victim to pay the ransom as the windows backup options may no longer exist popular ransomware exploiting victims through rdp include samsam responsible for significant damage in on the city of atlanta colorado department of transportation hospitals and other organizations a recent report estimated that samsam authors made million of revenues lowlevel crysis driveby downloads from a compromised website another entry path that attackers use to deliver ransomware is through what is known as driveby downloads these are malicious downloads that happen without a users knowledge when they visit a compromised website attackers often initiate driveby downloads by taking advantage of known vulnerabilities in the software of legitimate websites they then use these vulnerabilities to either embed the malicious code on a website or to redirect the victim to another site that they control which hosts software known as exploit kits exploit kits give hackers the ability to silently scan the visiting device for its specific weaknesses and if found execute code in the background without the user clicking anything the unsuspecting user will then suddenly be faced with a ransom note alerting them of the infection and demanding payment for returned files while this may sound like something encountered only on small under the radar sites driveby downloads are actually not limited to obscure websites they have happened to some of the most popular sites in the world including the new york times the bbc and the nfl all of these were targeted in a ransomware campaign through hijacked advertisements popular ransomware exploiting victims through driveby downloads include usb and removable media another avenue that ransomware uses to penetrate an environment is through a usb device in australian police issued a warning to citizens about usb drives containing malicious software appearing in mailboxes the usb drives masqueraded as a promotional netflix application then once opened deployed ransomware on to the unsuspecting users computer the mighty spora ransomware even added the capability to replicate itself onto usb and removable media drives in a hidden file formats jeopardizing subsequent machines in which the usb device is plugged into ransomware has become the goto attack of choice for cybercriminals to generate revenues its simple to buy on the dark web through ransomwareasaservice raas and attacks are relatively easy to launch through one of the above methods its important for organizations to recognize how their systems can be targeted and proactively take steps through a layered security approach to keep themselves protected and to safeguard their business service continuity antonio challita director of product management at cybersight image credit carlos amarillo shutterstocka new ransomware campaign targeting large organisations in the us and around the world has made the attackers behind it over in bitcoin in the space of just two weeks and appears to be connected to lazarus the hacking group working out of north korea from the exploitation phase through to the encryption process and up to the ransom demand itself the carefully operated ryuk campaign is targeting enterprises that are capable of paying a lot of money in order to get back on track said security company check point ryuk ransomware first emerged in midaugust and in the space of just days infected several organisations across the us encrypting pcs and storage and data centres of victims and demanded huge bitcoin ransoms one organisation is believed to have paid bitcoin around after falling victim to the attack the new ransomware campaign has been detailed by the researchers at check point who describe the attacks as highly targeted to such an extent that the perpetrators are conducting tailored campaigns involving extensive network mapping network compromise and credential stealing in order to reach the end goal of installing ryuk and encrypting systems see cybersecurity in an iot and mobile world zdnet special report download the report as a pdf techrepublic it sounds similar to the techniques used by those behind samsam ransomware which has made its authors over million although theres not thought to be a link between these two particular malicious operations researchers have yet to determine how exactly the malicious payload is delivered but users infected with ryuk are met with one of two ransom notes one is written almost politely claiming that the perpetrators have found a significant hole in the security systems of your company which has led to all files being encrypted and that a bitcoin ransom needs to be paid to retrieve the files remember we are not scammers the message concludes before stating how all files will be destroyed if a payment isnt received within two weeks image check point a second note is blunter simply stating that files have been encrypted and that a ransom must be paid in order to retrieve the files in both cases victims are given an email to contact and a bitcoin wallet address and are told that no system is safe from ryuk in both cases ransoms have been between and bitcoin with an additional half a bitcoin added for every day the victim doesnt give into the demands with such large ransoms being demanded it appears that the attackers have researched their victims and have come to the conclusion that theyll be willing to pay to retrieve their data it is reasonable to assume the threat actors had some prior knowledge about their victims and their financial background mark lechtik malware research team leader at check point told zdnet the fact that the targets are organizations and not individuals might lead to a scenario where they have highly valuable data encrypted which gives the perpetrators leverage to request higher amounts for its recovery in such cases and in light of the underlying business impact it becomes inevitable for the victims to pay the ransom he added if victims pay up the cryptocurrency is divided and transferred between multiple wallets as the attackers attempt to disguise where the funds came from see ransomware an executive guide to one of the biggest menaces on the web the ransomware hasnt been widely distributed indicating that careful planning is behind attacks against specific organisations but while the ryuk campaign is new researchers have found that the code is almost exactly the same as another form of ransomware hermes hermes ransomware first appeared late last year and has previously been connected to attacks conducted by the north korean lazarus hacking group including when it was used as a diversion for a m cyber heist against the far eastern international bank in taiwan researchers inspecting ryuks encryption logic have found it resembles hermes to such an extent that it still references hermes within the code and that a number of rules and instructions are the same in both forms of malware indicating identical source code thats led check point to two possible conclusions ryuk is a case of north korean hackers reusing code to conduct a new campaign or that it is the work of another attacker which has somehow gained access to the hermes source code in either case the specifically targeted attacks and the reconnaissance required in order to conduct them suggests that those behind ryuk have the time and resources necessary to carry out the campaign the current bounty of at least suggests its paying off and researchers warn that more attacks will come after succeeding with infecting and getting paid some we believe that this is not the end of this campaign and that additional organizations are likely to fall victim to ryuk said researchers read more on cyber crimethe first half of saw an uptick in fileless malware attacks and a downturn in ransomware attacks for now the use of fileless malware in attacks continues to grow and now represents out of endpoint attacks according to an analysis of data by one security firm the uptick represents a percent increase in the use of filelessbased attacks between january and june the study released tuesday by sentinelone also noted rollercoaster fluctuation in the prevalence of ransomware attacks in the same time period ransomware attacks represented just over out of attacks in january in february out attacks were tied to ransomware as of june ransomware attacks are at an alltime yearly low of per attacks our report found that ongoing advancements in fileless malware powershell attacks and ransomware continue to be a pain point as attackers continue to refine attacks to bypass legacy av the report stated as the name suggests fileless malware infects targeted computers leaving behind no artifacts on the local hard drive making it easy to sidestep traditional signaturebased security and forensics tools typical attacks exploit vulnerabilities in browsers and associated programs java flash or pdf readers or via a phishing attack that entices a victim to click on an attachment they prey on gullible targets clicking on malicious links or files in fileless malware attack scenarios no files are dropped on the targeted system rather code runs in the computers memory and calls on programs already on windows systems such as powershell and windows management instrumentation wmi correspondingly the same study showed attacks that leverage microsofts powershell jumped from attacks per endpoint attacks compared to attacks in may windows tools such as powershell are used by adversaries to remain persistent on systems thats because fileless malware needs to run code in the targeted systems randomaccess memory each time the endpoint is restarted the adversarys inmemory attack ends to work around those limitations attackers often will traverse from one application to another in some cases powershell will be used to open an application such as notepad or calculator in the background hidden from the user so the fileless malware can run in one of those applications memory footprint another means of gaining persistence is by loading a powershell script that instructs the targeted computer to reconnect to the attackers command and control each time the pc started so far this year has seen a number of fileless malware attacks kaspersky lab detailed its discovery in july of the powerghost fileless malwarecryptominer powerghost is an obfuscated powershell script first it plants itself in the targeted systems random access memory and used the wmi tool and the mimikatz data extraction tool to escalate privileges and set up its mining operation more recently researchers discovered cactustorch fileless malware that executes and loads malicious net files straight via the memorytrucking industry confronts growing threat of ransomware security experts had long warned the transportation industry was a major target for cyberattacks then a bombshell malware incident levied against international ocean shipper ap moller maersk publicly laid bare what was at stake several months after the socalled notpetya cyberattack hobbled maersks worldwide fleetmanagement it systems last year details about the magnitude of the attack and the collateral damage began to unfold maersk chairman jim hagemann snabe for example revealed during the world economic forum that took place earlier this year that the ransomware attack cost the company million to million it also required the replacement of servers computers and applications over the course of the days maersks shipping information network was held hostage to the ransomware attack of course the it infrastructures of fleets and motor carriers in the united states do not represent an applestoapples comparison to those of maersk however the it networks underpinning of transportation companies share several similarities to those of the shipping conglomerate including the underlying logistics and supply chain management systems while its difficult to gauge the effect of the maersk attack on the collective mindset of the trucking industry the incident likely served as a wakeup call for many motor carriers i know that we have always considered ransomware a threat said robert loya director of operations at cmi transportation but i certainly think it is possible that other carriers maybe hadnt considered it as much of a real menace than they previously did and it also is likely many privately held carriers already have experienced firsthand a ransomware attack but have not shared the incident publicly said ron godine a vice president at tmw systems firms might not disclose an attack until they are really in severe trouble or they cannot handle it and then theyre asking for help godine said or theyre able to take care of it internally themselves by destroying the evidence and then recovering from backups that they might have in place ransomware is obtained and downloaded on forums for a relatively small fee ultimately the perpetrator locks out access to a firms data or even the use of computers and servers while demanding a ransom to decrypt the systems getty images indeed carriers generally did not wish to discuss ransomware and its risks on the record for this article in consideration of among other things the negative attention of being associated with victims of attacks one representative from a carrier for example described how it was an awful feeling knowing you risk losing millions of dollars a day in the aftermath of a ransomware attack but wished to remain unnamed notpetya a modified variant of the petya ransomware attack is but one of many strains of malware that are in active circulation at this time ransomware variants targeting other industries include wannacry and spritecoin which is distributed as a cryptocurrency the modus operandi of cyber extortionists who orchestrate ransomware attacks is straightforward as the recently revealed details about the arrest of the ukrainian perpetrator who was responsible for spreading petya shows ransomware malware is easily obtained and downloaded on forums for a relatively nominal fee all it then takes is for one employee from a company to unwittingly click on a link in a phishing email in order for the malware to begin infiltrating the network the perpetrator eventually locks out access to a firms data or even the use of all computers and servers connected to the network while demanding a ransom to decrypt the systems protection and preparation for ransomware attacks require investments in it security which may prove challenging for smaller carriers boyd brothers transportation inc for example a carrier with revenue of million has the means to protect itself against ransomware and other kinds of cyberattacks more than a mom and pop firm with only five trucks might be able to the notpetya cyberattack crippled ocean shipper ap moller maersks worldwide fleetmanagement it systems last year glenflickr the smaller guys have a much bigger exposure to risk than the bigger companies do said chris cooper president of boyd brothers transportation which is part of flatbed firm daseke inc while the larger firms have more to lose if you monetize it the smaller guys risk losing their entire business overseas attackers who are relatively difficult to track down and prosecute from the united states with little to lose and much to gain often cast a wide net when seeking ransomware targets if the attacker can evoke an attack on thousands of companies per day then they are usually not selective of the companies they target and are only concerned the company has operational software solutions that can be affected said ben barnes chief information security officer for mcleod software transportation operations have become extremely dependent on software solutions and by default are as valuable a target the biggest risk in it security largely remains the inside threat employee education is thus critical while cybersecurity training should be part of new hires onboarding process carriers have good training procedures for drivers and everybody that touches the equipment said mark zachos president of dg technologies so they should offer something very similar for ransomware and cybersecurity protection training before boyd brothers transportation revamped its security policies and educational processes more than of its vice president and directorlevel executives clicked on a fake phishing email link the email was designed to look like it had originated from a legitimate transportationrelated website like a real phishing email would upon completion of a companywide training program the percentage of users tricked into responding to the fake phishing emails dropped to below cooper said the numbers were astonishing cooper said it was incredible to see how easy it is to click onto what you might think is a benign email before receiving the proper training boyd brothers transportations president says his company can protect itself against cyberattacks more so than a smaller carrier boyd brothers via youtube in addition to employee education truck carriers need to ensure their it departments are following standard industry it security practices these include documenting applications and systems closely managing systemsaccess backing up data installing effective network firewalls and virus security software consistently installing patches and updates creating a recovery plan in the event of an attack and active network monitoring said mcleod softwares barnes truck carriers also have access to industry groups that can support their ransomware protection practices american trucking associations recently created fleet cywatch for example was created to offer support against cyberattacks with ransomware prevention receiving much attention among other things fleet cywatch members receive by email information about cyber incidents while all details of targeted companies remain anonymous except for membership status vocation and industry descriptions relating to the victim company said dg technologies zachos who also is a fleet cywatch steering committee member in preparation for a possible attack for example fleet cywatch members learn how to follow procedures and to gain access to their data in order to get their systems up and running again they also know whom to call such as the fbi so the authorities can take the appropriate action we try to encourage a wide exchange of information the beauty of fleet cywatchs affiliation with ata is that its spread among all ata affiliate associations and reaches many smaller carriers said ross froat director of engineering and it with ata if you dont have a clue about cybersecurity and you subscribe to fleet cywatch and follow its recommendations you can learn directly about the policies and best practices your firm should follow putting policies and best practices in place can thus go a long way for ransomware attack readiness quite frankly if you spend time and resources into putting the necessary backups into place ransomware attacks do not have to cost millions of dollars said cooper of boyd brothers but if you do not and your system is down for more than a week then your company is at threat of going out of businessus network of cosco was hit by a ransomware attack one of the largest shipping giant of world falls prey to a ransomware attack when its american network was taken down which might lead to millions of dollars of overhead cost the ransomware attack was against cosco china ocean shipping company in a similar incident maersk a much larger shipping company and a rival of cosco suffered huge losses through a ransomware attack called notpetya the attack was so strong that it impacted all its operations on august the ransomware attack resulted in huge financial loss to the company which came out to be a whopping amount of million dollars to million dollars being a much smaller company as compared to maersk cosco supposedly would be suffering huge losses due to the operational infrastructure loss for its us network outage cosco blamed it on the local network failure cosco in its press release stated that due to local network breakdown within our america regions local email and network telephone cannot work properly at the moment it further said that in order to maintain safety measures and for further investigations the company has shut down its connections with the other regions for now however bleeping computer quoted that within the companys internal emails that were seen by various maritime news sites cosco has referred the attack as ransomware infection though cosco has not responded to bleeping computer on this but it has already warned all its employees to not open any suspicious emails and ask to use antivirus software to clean its internal networks from time to time the attack happened on july and it impacted the companys it infrastructure of american region including telephone network and email servers us website of the company has also gone offline due to this attack the us employees of the company are using public email accounts of yahoo for replying to the customer queries reported through social media alienvault security advocate javvad malik said its important to have good threat detection and response controls in place so that any attack can be dealt with swiftly he further added that cosco was wise enough to segregate its infected network from their other networks so that they can prevent the attack from spreading further spamfighter news imagine this youve just built a stateoftheart system for your business to store all of its records and customer data its working seamlessly and allowing your team to run efficiently while seemingly keeping all of your information secure then it disappears hackers contact you and demand that you pay a ransom you cant afford to get your data back you dont have that amount of money and dont have any guarantee that theyll actually follow through with their promise even if you do pay but your business cannot function without that data what do you do this is the situation that acare ceo percy syddall found himself in several years back and its become all too common for other businesses as well as a home health care company in california acares situation was especially sensitive due to the fact that patient records and health information had been compromised while every ransomware attack presents unique challenges to businesses this one illustrates many of the concerns that accompany such a situation since then syddall and his team have taken great care to enhance their cybersecurity efforts and hopefully prevent a similar situation from ever impacting acare in the same way here are some tips and insights to consider if your business ever has to deal with a ransomware attack or if you want to prevent one from happening in the first place what to do if ransomware attacks your small business evaluate the threat every ransomware attack is different so there isnt one right way to handle the situation most experts advise against paying ransoms as theres still no guarantee that youll get your data back in some cases like screenlocking ransomware you may be able to find a professional who can get around it and unlock your system get authorities involved at the time of acares attack ransomware was a relatively unknown concept however today the fbi has an internet crime complaint center thats specifically set up so that you can report online crimes like ransomware attacks youll want to photograph the ransom notification and any other communication from the attacker to include with your report alert your customers syddall says that the hardest part about dealing with the attack was having to tell each of his customers that their personal data had been compromised its certainly not an activity that any business owner looks forward to but your customers need to know if an attacker or anyone outside your organization has gained access to any confidential information youve given them find new solutions at the time of the attack acares system was protected by two major antivirus software programs those programs performed weekly scans to detect threats but syddall believes that attack happened overnight and thus went undetected after the attack he began searching for something that would provide a higher level of protection in addition to basic protection practices the company now utilizes boldcloud a security solution that essentially adds an insurance policy to your data in case your system is compromised and backups fail ask the right questions syddall says i always ask people when they pitch me these solutions am i hackable if they say no not with this solution then i know theyre just trying to sell me something and not really being honest about what they offer continue to look out for new solutions syddall adds even though were very happy with boldcloud im always open to new solutions and adding to our current protections you never know when a new type of threat is going to pop up and what new tools might be out there to help you fight it marcus chung ceo and cofounder of boldcloud agrees that adapting to new situations is important small businesses face special and unique challenges daily most have limited resources cybersecurity expertise and most importantly limited time the vast majority of todays threats attack broadly and do not discriminate whether your business is a fortune forbes business or not every business needs to be vigilant prepare to adapt your security with a layered approach be proactive and then stay safe back up important files syddall says that his company was lucky because they did keep hard copies of customer contracts that they could refer to during the attack however they didnt have backups of anything else which made operating during that time a major challenge now they keep hard copies of other important documents as well just enough so that they can continue operations in the event of an attack if you prefer not to keep physical files at least make sure your data is backed up in another system or location that you can access if your main one is attacked monitor employee activity there are certain types of sites or links that are more likely to lead to a member of your team inadvertently exposing your system to ransomware to limit those threats consider implementing training sessions blocking high risk sites or monitoring employee use so you can speak with those who expose your system to threats by visiting those high risk sites always put customer relationships first after this situation was resolved syddall continued to make customer communication a major part of his business he continues to reach out to clients to make sure their data hasnt been used or compromised any further and ensures people that theyre being vigilant to avoid future attacksits become a fact of life that hackers might lock down your computer blocking access to your most valuable data and vowing to free it only if you pay up ransomware is nothing new but its profitable and hackers are deploying it left and right mitigating ransomware is actually fairly straightforward if you have backups if your network is segmented really all you have to do is wipe the infected computers and reimage them from backups if youre prepared the recovery takes maybe minutes but if its so easy to recover from ransomware why is it still such a problem it comes down to human psychology if we truly want to stop ransomware in its tracks it takes an understanding of the real problems that this malware preys on here are four things you need to know about ransomware if were ever going to stop it the real target of ransomware might not be what you think if you think your it systems are the target of ransomware youre not alone but youre also not correct your it systems are just the delivery mechanism the real target is your employees ransoms rely on psychological manipulation that it systems arent susceptible to ai isnt there just yet the systems are the prisoner being held for money the psychology of ransomware is complex and the two main types locker and crypto use different tactics and are successful within different populations of people more on this later its not just a case of getting your workforce to abide by security rules and keep their eyes open for dodgy ransom notes this just helps prevent the data and system from becoming prisoners you must recognize their unique psychological susceptibilities and design work practices that prevent individuals within your workforce from becoming attractive targets who is more likely to fall for ransomware and how to stop them as mentioned above ransomware uses complex psychological tactics to get their targets to pay the two main types of ransomware play off different psychological vulnerabilities crypto finds and encrypts valuable data and typically asks for a fee to unencrypt the files often creating a time pressure for paying crypto plays on the endowment effect in the victim taking advantage of the value people place in what they own versus what they dont it also makes use of the ellsberg paradox by making it look like there is a certain and positive outcome if the target complies with the ransom demand eg they get their data back as opposed to an uncertain and potentially negative outcome if they dont eg their boss will be mad and they may or may not lose their job by contrast locker ransomware typically locks a system preventing the target from using it and imposes a fine for release it often works by deception with the perpetrator posing as an authority figure who has supposedly identified a misdemeanor and uses the dishonesty principle the conviction that anything you have done wrong will be used against you to get you to comply with their wishes the effects of both these tactics are greatly amplified if the target is physically isolated from their colleagues and their organizational support network or even if they perceive themselves to be when you look at the victims of ransomware theyre often remote workers or people who associate themselves primarily with their profession rather than their employer eg doctors nurses policemen and so on if youre in an openplan office and a ransomware screen pops up youre likely to point it out to your colleagues before acting yourself however if you are in your home office or feel only loosely affiliated with your employer youre more likely to take matters into your own hands the risk of ransomware can be reduced by fostering a corporate culture that reduces the feelings of real or perceived isolation how to shortcircuit the entire value prop behind ransomware if youre hit with ransomware your data and it systems are the ransom prisoners held hostage until the perpetrators receive payment but theres a crucial difference between your data and the traditional prisoner in a ransom scheme like a person or an object of monetary value data unlike a person is easily copied or cloned when you think about it logically hackers shouldnt be able to hold data for ransom by withholding access to it if you always have a copy or the ability to create a copy theres no point in paying a ransom to have the original released likewise its now the norm to access our data through multiple devices which means that locking one access route has limited impact while the only option for goods and people is to deploy security measures to protect them data and it systems can be protected by duplication its not only cheaper but also more practical the perpetrators could of course threaten to publicise sensitive data they hold to ransom but this is technically extortionware rather than ransomware how companies avoid becoming ransomware victims ransomware attacks arent over when your systems get infected and locked down when you launch your response and recovery the attack is almost always still taking place and you might have to shift strategies on the fly as any military commander will tell you plans rarely survive first contact with the enemy this means that if you only have a single response plan without the means to deviate from it your opponent will quickly learn what it is and overcome it in short you will become a victim obviously its essential to have a solid backup strategy and business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements in place but your response wont succeed unless you also have the crisis leadership skills and knowledge to adapt your response in real time you must lead your organization through the complex uncertain and unstable environment thats created by a largescale ransomware attack how do you stop ransomware theres no single solution to the ransomware problem however organizations that are most successful at managing the associated risks have taken advantage of features that data and it systems offer to back up and protect their data while recognizing that much can be done to safeguard their people from becoming targets by understanding the psychology behind ransomware and how it affects your employees you can sidestep the risk of ransomware and avoid becoming the next victimwhen it comes to cybercrime online attacks often follow seasonal trends so as the kids head back to school its safe to assume that cybercriminals have learned and developed some new ransomware tricks that will be coming to a computer near you this fall most healthcare organizations are probably not prepared to deal with this new wave of attacks among the endless flow of sensational cyberattack headlines including notpetya and the erie county medical center its easy to become numb to the threat of ransomwarechoosing to believe that your organization is either too small to be a likely target or that your existing cybersecurity measures provide adequate protection unfortunately this optimism has led to the peril of many healthcare providers and in turn the patients they serve the biggest cybersecurity concern used to be hackers invading healthcare systems to steal sensitive patient data and then selling it to the highest bidder but today one of the easiest assaults on a computer system is ransomwarea debilitating attack through which an anonymous criminal encrypts your files and then forces you to pay them whatever amount they request in order to regain access to your systemand all the important files it may contain sonicwall recently reported there have been million ransomware attacks during the first six months of which marks a percent increase over this same time frame in encrypted threats are up percent over last year why has ransomware become the primary cyber threat out there most experts point to four primary factors finding a buyer the key to any successful transaction is finding a buyer that is willing to pay to acquire whatever it is that you are selling when it comes to selling data on the dark web searching for a buyer is tricky and comes with many risks selling something directly to the person you stole it from improves the odds of getting paid quickly and quietly the key to any successful transaction is finding a buyer that is

networking and hardware now easytouse ransomware as a service can be purchased cheaply on the darknet some vendors even offer customer support for buyers of their malware and wouldbe hackers who want customized ransomware can hire blackhat coders for its development smaller healthcare organizations are an easy target for hackers because most dont have adequate financial or technical resources to defend themselves against the onslaught attacks according to cryptonite healthcare organizations have reported an percent yearoveryear increase in ransomware attacks no healthcare provider wants to be a victim of a ransomware attack but cybersecurity is a complex problem that requires multiple layers of defenses many healthcare organizations feel they cant afford to keep their practice safe because it typically requires deploying sophisticated endpoint technologies such as antivirus antimalware software and firewalls to keep intruders out and then hiring resources to keep up with frequent software data backups and equipment security updates as well as providing security training for staff industry experts estimate that an organization with employees may have to spend upward of to have the best possible protection against cyberthreats and then thousands of dollars each year to keep everything up to date but even when organizations make this investment in security they might still have a breach hackers are becoming extremely resourceful and have found ways to circumvent even the most advanced antivirus and antiransomware solutions these solutions cannot protect against fully undetectable fud threats that were conceived by cyber criminals to directly evade existing security layers and harm data recent tenable research reveals cybercriminals have a median sevenday window of opportunity during which they can exploit a vulnerability to attack their victims ponemons state of endpoint security risk report suggests that percent of organizations dont believe their antivirus can stop the threats theyre now seeing even fireeye reports in percent of the breaches to which they responded firewalls and antivirus protections were up to date antivirus software monitors for the signatures of known threats so it cant deal in realtime with all of the fresh attacks constantly evolving in dark web incubators other behaviorbased security approaches use machine learning to identify threats for example if an email attachment tries to access a large number of files quickly or an unexpected file starts encrypting files a behaviorbased approach tries to shut it down todays attackers simply avoid detection by changing the predictable characteristics of ransomwareslowing down or randomizing encryption or lying dormant for a period of time before executing the attack to close this gap healthcare organizations are adopting new forms of defenses that use mirror shielding technology which enables users to recover files when other malware defenses like antivirus and antiransomware software fail unlike antivirus tools new mirror shielding technologies arent dependent on signatures of known threats and dont require users to download software updates to effectively protect and prevent malicious attacks mirror shielding makes an attacker believe he or she has taken control of an organizations data files but the attacker is seeing a mirror image of the system and does not have actual possession of the data in the event that a user receives a ransom demand or notices that the files have been unintentionally altered the user simply clicks a button and reverts back to the original files multiple revisions of the file are stored so that users can go back to the right version this groundbreaking technology doesnt require a backup procedure so there is virtually no impact on computer performance as attackers get smarter so must defenses taking a waitandsee approach is becoming too risky while there arent any silver bullet solutions that will complete eradicate all cyberthreats healthcare organizations finally have the equivalent of a doover button when things do go wrong because of a ransomware attack with this assurance healthcare organizations can continue to focus on treating patients and revenue generating activities instead of scrambling to recover their files if they get caught by the latest ransomware threat this

curriculum teaching learning and leadership his other activities include you have a voice a project to develop an electronic screening assessment to identify human trafficking victims a local furniture store was recently victimized by a ransomware attack these types of attacks come in two general forms there are variations one is where data is encrypted and made inaccessible in some way and a fee has to be paid to regain access the other is when information is stolen then a ransom is demanded with the threat that the data will be released or the people impacted contacted the primary issue is that someone with unauthorized access has confidential data and even if a ransom is paid there is no guarantee that the data will be destroyed or that it has been or will be managed appropriately by the adversary what does an organization do when they are the victim of a ransomware attack can the victimized organization be guaranteed that the data will be restored or not released publicly or to the affected parties contact your local law enforcement immediately if you dont have an incident response in place have the local fbi and secret service field office numbers in your contact list you will also want to alert your legal counsel in vermont you will have to report the breach to the attorney generals office your counsel should be able to provide your public relations person with verbiage when the public and customer inquiries begin determining whether to pay the ransom is a question you want to discuss with your legal counsel paying the ransom is a major organizational decision it encourages the criminals involved there is no guarantee the data will be restored or not released publicly there could be demands for money or it could be used for future requests for money create an incident response plan to prepare respond detect contain eradicate and recover from the attack part of the incident response process is to prepare for this type of attack which involves understanding that it could happen one comment made by the furniture store vice president was i honestly dont think i believed it to begin with its something you see in the movies something you see on tv but its never something that i thought would happen to us especially here in vermont attackers do not generally care where you are located size of your organization or who you are you have to be prepared even if you have never been victimized by this type of attack you have to prepare and have a plan in place if it does occur however it starts with implementing basic security measures to minimize being impacted by the most common types of attacks detection means to determine where the malicious software entered and if it has spread to other computers containment means all affected systems have been identified and those systems monitored andor isolated to ensure the software doesnt spread further eradicate means all occurrences of the malicious code have been removed otherwise they could steal or lock more data and demand money in the future recover means the organization goes through the process to ensure this type of attack or other attacks dont recur and the impacted systems are restored to production if you do not know where to start heres a template consider whether you can recover from the breach with your backup systems or processes first ensure you are backing up your data and test it periodically to determine whether the data you expect to be recovered is being backed up and can be recovered this testing process is really critical you have to test your backup systems and retrieve data periodically to ensure it can be retrieved when needed
